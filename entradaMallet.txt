1 positivo gets 4 BIG stars from me!2 positivo Really Enjoyed it ! A great find, the scenery/locations were beautiful and the story held up the whole way. A great date movie. You won't be sorry.3 positivo A lovely story I was surprised, and so touched, by this movie. What a delightful find! A friend recommended it, and they weren't wrong at all. The story is lovely, with a lot of heart. The story gave me hope, and inspiration, and a desire to have my own magic happen by the sea!! Really, a must watch, good to cuddle up with a loved one.4 negativo has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution5 neutral A twist (in the wind) ending 6 positivo My 2 y/o grandson loves it!! 7 negativo titled "Hollywood Debacle" The plot is so ridiculous Get real! Utterly, completely stupid.8 positivo Addictive, witty, clever, and utterly addictive You'll enjoy watching and re-watching for time to come.9 positivo Just Good TV. is a pleasant surprise.10 positivo 5 Stars. Of course, there's also a good dose of sex, glamor and money, all of which make the series a pleasure to watch!11 neutral After you watch a few episodes, it will be fairly clear to you who the two central characters are.12 positivo Awesomely Fun!!! 13 positivo I loved it. 14 positivo Great British Show 15 positivo Best people-handling skills ever 16 positivo Great character development.

I've enjoyed it a very great deal. 19 positivo it's great TV!!!!20 positivo you must own it like I did!!!:-)21 positivo Smart, Funny, and it doesn't take itself too seriously.22 positivo Love this show !  its slick , glossy , glamorous , funny , serious , suggestive !23 positivo Love it, love it, love it some more 24 positivo Clever, funny, addictive Great series with a great mix of comedy, drama, and romance. The characters have a great chemistry and the supporting cast just adds another additional reason to watch.25 negativo all the characters are monochromatic and shameless stereotypes: unctuous Italian, gay black, trampy receptionist .At least I didn't suffer the humiliation of paying for it.26 neutral  Joy in God--necessary? Or simply optional??? 27 positivo I've watched these videos multiple times and glean something from it every time.28 positivo I am so grateful for the Blazing Center DVD and the exceptional price. I enjoyed immensely seeing the dynamic presentation by an author I have read for all these years. I would love to see this DVD given to many of our grandchildren.29 positivo Outstanding This is a wonderful DVD for teens and adults alike.30 positivo Great Study!31 negativo Bad Deal!! 32 negativo Creepy33 negativo audio options non existent. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock.34 positivo She seemed to Enjoy it overall.35 positivo Must see.36 negativo disappointing... 37 negativo Very problematic depiction 38 positivo Excellent movie. Top quality screenplay, impressive actors. Highly recommended to see.39 positivo Divinely Wonderful40 negativo As Bad a Production as Possible41 positivo Hands down the best SCHOOL... What a pleasure to share a high pleasure like this with them.42 negativo Witty and worthy production.43 neutral Interesting adaptation 44 negativo Not professional quality 45 neutral three to four stars - depending... Must see for theatre students.46 positivo The best workout video ever.  enjoyable workout.47 positivo The best video workout I've ever exercised with!  Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!48 positivo Cory Everson's Total Body Workout. Cory's videos are really good. She's very positive. If you'll try this one you may like it, it's great for starters. Keep Moviated! Good luck!49 positivo Toned. It's my all time favorite.50 negativo Think twice about purchasing this video prior to viewing 51 positivo perfect. Good workout and fun.

Fine.59 positivo excellent video for boys 60 neutral not interesting enough for little ones I wish I had read the other reviews before buying this particular video.61 positivo good movie 62 neutral It's just OK, not great 63 positivo Great DVD.64 positivo Great Movie! 65 positivo My son enjoys watching Thomas and Friends.66 positivo Kids loved it! They watch the video everyday!67 positivo Great Gift, Great Price. The product shipped on time & the quality was great too.68 positivo They'd watch it nonstop69 negativo Very annoying! This video is really a disappointment. I was totally annoyed.70 neutral 10 Years of Thomas is FINALLY going on DVD!71 negativo WARNING: may cause excessive nagging 72 negativo Extremely Disappointed with this video73 negativo Not as expected.74 positivo Great Lessons! Our two-year old grandson loved this75 positivo My 3 yr old grandson loves Thomas and all his friends.76 positivo great 77 positivo Great for kids.78 positivo Not exactly as the pictures. My kids love it!79 positivo So cute. he just loves it!80 positivo A Grandsons love of Thomas81 neutral All collections are sure to entertain and recommended for public libraries and family collections alike.82 negativo Just so-so. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either.83 negativo I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.84 negativo A long promo. Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial. Waste of money.85 negativo Poor DVD. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD.86 positivo Great Video for kids. Great fun for the kids (which is nice for mom & dad too)87 positivo I love this dvd.88 positivo Great for the Kids. This is a great dvd and well worth the price89 neutral Nice compilation, but DVD could be better90 positivo 10 GREAT STORIES ON DVD + SING-A-LONG & A FEW SPECIAL FEATURES = 5 STAR ENTERTAINMENT91 negativo That is, pretty much every episode finds the engines "cross" -- I'm starting to get real sick of that word!92 positivo Nice mix of Thomas episodes and real footage. but the rest is really good.93 positivo If you only buy one Thomas DVD, make this one it! 94 positivo Nice Thomas Sampler. Highly recommended here.95 negativo My Son finds it annoying. he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD.96 negativo Feels like a commercial. *sigh*97 positivo Love it! My son loves this video!!! he enjoys the stories, but really loves the scenes 98 positivo Enjoyable video for the kids Good video for the kids. 99 positivo Good movie.100 positivo The fantasy scenes featuring her are more attractive than you would expect.101 positivo Fantastic Movie. I loved the music, the actors and the story the scenery and the chemistry between the two leading actors. SRK is lovable and his acting is always superb whatever role he plays.102 positivo I recommend it to everyone.103 neutral Cute storyline in the beginning After the first half it's not as magical, though still full of undying love as most SRK movies are .104 positivo Awesome Love Story!!! What an amazing & beautiful story of a couple so much in love105 positivo Great Actors - Well done film!106 neutral Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying. Check it out!107 positivo Amazing... love it...108 positivo My two cents. Well done.109 neutral Great movie, not so great DVD. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better.110 positivo an extreme emotional ride111 negativo pick another! - pick a different film.112 neutral Mixed feelings. Not a favorite.113 negativo Not my favorite. but I'll probably never watch this one again.114 positivo I really enjoyed this movie. EVERYTHING is so wonderful and will have you humming for days. you'll love this one!115 negativo please don't waste your time.116 positivo I give it a 5 anyway.117 positivo I absolutely love this movie. I wish they did more movies together.118 positivo Must See 119 positivo This is another epic love creation with this beautiful, talented "OMG" sexy man. He can tear at your heart with just one look. He is so incredibly talented.120 positivo I'm in love!!!! A very good actress too. I'am looking forward in collecting more movies from India.121 positivo Comedy Rules! He loved it 122 negativo Not Quite So Funny. Not bad enough to ruin the movie as a whole, but it sure came close.123 positivo MUCH SMARTER THAN THE TITLE LEADS YOU TO BELIEVE! I enjoyed 'Funny People'.124 neutral Funny Yet Serious People First of all. All in all, it's still a hilarious movie and worth a see when and if you have almost three hours to spare.125 negativo 12 Y/O Potty Humor From 40 somethings does not a comedy make. Saw this movie and felt compelled to warn people not to waste 144 agonizing minutes of their lives. In a nutshell,126 negativo Soooooooooooo NOT Funny This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring.127 positivo I loved it. I really liked this movie.128 negativo Totally Unfunny. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing.129 negativo Nasty People! Nasty Film! 130 negativo zero star. those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE.131 negativo Dramedy. This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. You're not missing a thing.132 negativo The Not so Funny People. I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen!.Some may like, but it's NOT my cup of tea!133 negativo UNFUNNY PEOPLE. You'll want those minutes from your life back.134 negativo  Dont let it trick you, only see this if its free.135 negativo Excruciating! There are much better ways to spend 2 and a half hours of your life than watching this disappointing piece of garbage!136 negativo Please take the money and send it to Africa instead. Instead of wasting a dime on this failure, send the money to someone who can use it. This is the first movie in 25 years I threw in the trash. I didn't even want to give it away for fear the person I gave it to would never talk to me again for punishing them. Bottom line, buy something else. Of the great comedians in this film, none were remotely funny or entertaining. It is almost as if they were bored while filming it.137 negativo Very Disappointing.138 negativo Saga of a Depressed, Lonely Comedian Lacks Punch139 neutral Its Not What Youre Expecting. Don't skip it due to bad reviews and dont watch it thinking you're going to see an Oscar pic.140 positivo serious comedy F141 negativo Long, somewhat dull and unfocused. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me.142 positivo This movie is great143 neutral It had its moments in the beginning but started to lose steam halfway through the movie.144 positivo Sandler's best movie This is a hilarious movie with a great message. This is definitely Adam Sandler's best movie ever. This is a must see! Great actors funny and touching with a great message.145 positivo Movie tells a great story.146 positivo Great Movie, Great Cast! This was an excellent movie. The right balance of funny and feeling. And SO many cameos.147 positivo Far better than it's reputation, and well worth. a look Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance148 positivo Apatow's Depth Triumphs. Great director, great cast, and a hell of an perspective on alternative comedy. Lastly, buy the collector's edition. The bonus features are endless! 149 positivo The Marketing was Wrong, but the Film is so RIGHT. Anyways, great movie.150 neutral Flawed and Meandering Yet Still a Worthwhile Look Inside a Stand-Up Comic's Mind.151 neutral Flawed, but still a misunderstood and underappreciated film. 152 positivo  I'll continue to watch his movies.153 negativo WHICH JOKE DID YOU FIND FUNNY?. If you think a guy saying "tweet" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you.154 positivo Underrated. Just put yourself in that mindset, and you'll really enjoy this movie.155 positivo Decent movie I'm surprised at how much I liked this movie.156 neutral There's a Good Movie in There Somewhere. I feel this film is very misunderstood.157 positivo Far better than its reputation, and well worth a look. Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance.158 neutral "Funny People" has a poignant strong beginning and then turns into something completely different in the second act.159 positivo Suprisingly good movie.160 negativo Starts out with promise, but then goes downhill.161 negativo I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it.162 neutral By the end, it felt like i just finished a TV movie without the commercials....So for what it is, its good, but not a keeper.163 positivo Good, good movie. This is a very impressive movi. Nicely done, well worth it.164 positivo This release is loaded with special features. An unrated, extended cut of the movie is included along with the theatrical release. While full of humorous moments, it lacks some of the over-the-top hilarious moments that Apatow fans may have come to expect from his movies. However, this movie is extremely honest, and that is becoming more and more of a rare commodity.165 negativo Some decent moments, but Apatow's pony needs a new trick. Some funny moments make it worth watching, but in general it's too long and too scattershot. In short: worth seeing if you love these actors, otherwise, plenty of other films are worthier of your time.166 positivo One of the best surprises.167 positivo This is a great movie, flaws and all. Or should I say most importantly, I found it entertaining.168 positivo But It's Still a Good Movie. It's not something I'd enjoy watching repeatedly, or pull out again on a sick day to watch, but it is worth renting and watching once.169 neutral Interesting but... 170 neutral An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler171 neutral Average Comedy. This movie is definately funny but it's also nothing special.Yes, this one is worth renting, but die hard Adam Sandler fans might be a little dissapointed.172 negativo Not what I expected.173 negativo I've Never Hated an Adam Sandler Movie Until Now174 negativo Couldn't give it less than one star. this movie was looooong and booooring!!!175 negativo This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!176 negativo Worst movie I've ever seen This movie was HORRIBLE!177 neutral Not Sandlers best. I just found it all lacking.178 negativo worst film ever. skip it!!!!!!!!!!!179 negativo The L O N G E S T movie... EVER!  In my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD.180 negativo profanity the movie!!! or profanity and the degenerates.!!! if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you.181 negativo Kept this movie from getting a 'ZERO' star rating!! A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!!182 negativo Stupid.... Wouldn't recommend!183 neutral not for everyone, and that's a fact184 negativo Painful.185 neutral Weakest Film Is Also His Most Mature Effort. However, mature or not, this is Judd Apatow's weakest film and will have the shortest shelf-life of the films he has made thus far.GRADE: C+186 negativo Painful 187 positivo A truly deep, extremely moving and wonderful movie188 positivo Very funny movie. very memorable comedy.189 positivo Great for What It Is. it kept me engaged throughout.190 positivo Smart Movie Funny People: 8 out of 10. I found myself enjoying the laid back pace at 153 minutes there is no question this feels more like a directors cut than a tightly paced theatrical release.191 negativo Don't waste your time and money on this.192 negativo Not good193 neutral Worth watching at least once 194 positivo Half funny, half offensive.195 positivo Unexpected, in a good way!196 neutral If you must see it, rent it.197 positivo Brilliant movie, and much more complex material. I enjoyed it from front to back.198 positivo Funny, Heartwarming and Mature. Come for the X-rated laughs and stay for the sophisticated, thoughtful drama.199 positivo Much better than I expected. That was a great scene.200 negativo waste of time. It took half hour when I stopped watching.201 negativo Depressing then becomes boring. this will be a waste of your time202 negativo Please just run far FAR away from this film. I wish someone had warned me.203 negativo Flash in the pan.204 negativo THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!!!205 negativo DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.206 negativo Crude, demeaning and a waste of my time!207 positivo this one shall become more and more appreciated in the years/decades to come as well.208 positivo I loved this movie.209 neutral If you think a guy saying "tweet" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you.210 positivo This is the perfect movie211 positivo I liked it.212 positivo great movie213 negativo weakest work to date. Skip this.214 negativo Twice as long, half as funny, and much the same.215 negativo is just too moody/messy to recommend.216 negativo A complete mess.217 neutral Not entirely a comedy I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in.218 positivo Highly underrated. Great Film.219 negativo it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre.220 negativo ACTUALLY NO STARS. Its AWFUL.221 negativo Not worth the time.222 negativo movie horrible.

The BEST in the Killer Tomatoes quartet of movies, a classic comedy spoof. it is an instant classic.233 positivo Kept me Laughing. I LOVED this movie! 234 positivo AN UNFORGETTABLE FILM!. Discovering this DVD was a dream come true for me.235 positivo Just plain fun to watch. A must have for us old 'B' movie aficionados.236 positivo  And you hear people gigling and the movie ends.237 positivo The best flick. This is IMHO the best of the 4 238 positivo I Was Very Satisfied With My Purchase. I Am Glad We Were Able To Find An Older Movie We Were Looking For239 neutral Not as funny as I thought it would be240 positivo Highly recomended!241 positivo If there aren't enough 5 stars for you, here's another one!
