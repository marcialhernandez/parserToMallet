He manages to free his hands, untie his bound feet and safely escape from a barrage of rifle fire.For a day and night Farquhar flees through an endless forest in the general direction of home-- some 30 miles distant. All through this taxing journey he thinks about wife and kids. Peyton begins to imagine strange sights and noises, and is convinced that he dozes even while walking.

The formula is fool proof: assemble a hotel staff of strongly drawn characters, each with a secret past; add dashes of sexual tension, avarice, silliness and whimsy; then, in each episode fold in a parade of hotel guests, everyone arriving with their own baggage of deceit, pathos, and lunacy. The result is a comedy that has dark dramatic undertones, and a drama that breaks into giggles when the tension reaches a breaking point.The promotional trailers aired on BBCA did not do this justice. Those soundbites made it seem as though the series was a debauched soap opera designed to attract a viewership of self- pleasuring adolescent boys. What a delightful surprise to find such a well-written, well acted series. Serious subjects such as immigration raids and drug trafficking crimelords shift stage with rock stars who refuse to party and sophomoric revenge raids on rival hotels.The action centers around Charlie (Max Beesley), the deputy general manager with a murky past, as he adjusts to his new status in one of London's swankiest hotels. The rest of the staff (many it seems have either shagged him or want to) make his job a challenge, but ultimately pull together to solve the myriad of crises brought on them daily by the guests, who are all played by major stars themselves. (Anthony Stewart Head as the suicidal jingle writer will have you falling off your sofa choking with laughter; Joan Collins as the aging noblewoman will leave you wistful). As the series progresses, the viewer comes to feel sisterly sympathy for the sluttishly obsequious receptionist Anna (Emma Pierson), and certain conspiracy with the barmaster Gino (Martin Marquez). For me? My secret crush has always been Tony the Concierge (Dexter Fletcher), as he knows all, sees, all, can solve all, and is the most centered and upright of them all.You won't regret purchasing this DVD. Each episode is a little treat unto itself (e.g. Episode Six, a homage to Hitchcock, must have been a hoot to film; it's a treasure to watch). You'll enjoy watching and re-watching for time to come.","review\/time":"1198972800","review\/userId":"A11ES13Y6490","tipo":"positivo"},

McKenzie","review\/score":"4.0","review\/summary":"\"Guilty Pleasure?\"...Nope, Just Good TV","review\/text":"HOTEL BABYLON has to be one of the most incorrectly-advertised TV shows I've seen. When airing on BBC America this past summer, it appeared to be some glamourized soap opera with sexy women. BBC American salaciously promoted it on \"Wicked Wednesdays\". These commercials didn't even hint that HOTEL BABYLON was actually a breezy, fast-paced, funny, and surprisingly truthful look at a 5-star London hotel's happenings.Each of the 8 episodes begins and ends with narration by Charlie (Max Beesley), the Deputy Manager of the hotel. Think Augustus Hill from OZ, or the opening quotes from THE WIRE. Charlie's philosophical monologues on the hotel business cleverly bookend each episode. Other characters include:Rebecca (Tamzin Outwaithe) - the workaholic hotel managerTony (Dexter Fletcher from LOCK, STOCK, & TWO SMOKING BARRELS) - a loyal concierge who's mostly the moral center of the showAnna (Emma Pearson) - the superficial receptionist you can't help but put up withThere are other hotel faces that you'll learn along the way, and each is given an appropriate amount of screentime. Cameos don't steal the show, and reoccuring characters are well-balanced throughout the season.What separates HOTEL BABYLON from other tongue-in-cheek comedy-dramas is that although the stories in this show are exaggerated, they all carry a dose of reality. Should there be strange noises and electrical failures during the midnight shift? Probably not, but any hotel employee knows that midnight shifts are as weird as they get. Would rebellious staff members assemble a mock wedding at a guest's request? Highly unlikely, but I've been asked by a guest for stranger favors. Would hotel staff and guests have fraternize, flirt, and have private get-togethers? Well...yeah, I've seen that happen.HOTEL BABYLON treads a very delicate between a variety of genres. There are gut-wrenching laughs and moments that elicit small smirks. The drama can be very serious, but it's never cyncial or mean-spirited. The show is sexy, but not pornographic. The music is sometimes classy, and sometimes deliberately pop.What keeps HOTEL BABYLON captivating, however, is its truthfulness to the world it creates. The acting is very strong, the photography is incredibly stylish (Guy Ritchie - take notes!), the characters are portrayed more with conviction than mockery, the production is top-notch, and the adventures (even the crazy ones) are so well-paced and structured that you just can't help but go along for the ride.People who've worked in a hotel will appreciate the outlandish circumstances this staff can be put in, and how ridiculously dedicated and knowledgable the staff are required to be. And if you've never worked in a hotel before...after HOTEL BABYLON, you'll appreciate the guest services provided and definitely be a better sport on your next vacation. Cheers!Give HOTEL BABYLON a peek. Considering my favorite shows are darker ones like THE WIRE and BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, this BBC gem along with the new DOCTOR WHO is a pleasant surprise.","review\/time":"1198108800","review\/userId":"AZ9JWGE1UGKZ","tipo":"positivo"},

And I must say, the British have some outstanding shows.\"Hotel Babylon\" is easily one of hippest, sexiest shows in recent memory -- miles ahead of NBC's \"Las Vegas\". Of course much of that can be contributed to the sharp writing and attractive cast, as well as the sleek sets and gorgeous shots of London.Still, there's a lot more to this series than meets the eye. Newly appointed deputy manager Charlie Edwards (Max Beesley) serves as the series' narrator, navigating the trials and tribulations that the staff of the five-star property meet each day.Above Max is Rebecca Mitchell (Tamzin Outhwaite), the Hotel's general manager. She's a gorgeous, confident woman who handles everything from \"ordinary guests\" to rock stars and even foreign delegates. Though highly poised on the outside, she's hiding a number of secrets that are revealed as the series progresses -- among them the fact that she's left her husband and is currently living inside the hotel itself.The supporting cast is as diverse as it is amusing. Guest concierge Tony Casemore (Dexter Fletcher) does everything from getting theater tickets and restaurant tables, to high-class prostitutes for the rock stars who inevitably arrive from time to time. Joining him at the front desk area is receptionist Anna Thorton-Wilton (Emma Pierson), an old flame of Charle's and a rather superficial social climber.\"Hotel Babylon\" alternates between the day-to-day grind of the hotel business to the persona lives of the characters. All of them seem to have secrets of some kind -- ones that eventually rear their ugly heads on the job. Of course, there's also a good dose of sex, glamor and money, all of which make the series a pleasure to watch!","review\/time":"1219881600","review\/userId":"A1C08KLFIHSJ","tipo":"positivo"},

The pacing is very well done. There is not a lot of downtime before character development begins automatically drawing you into the world that the characters inhabit. You immediately know which characters you are going to love and which ones you are going to love to hate. Working in the hotel industry myself in New York City I really enjoy seeing the characters go through the same trials and tribulations of the glitzy and glamorous world of it all if not a little more exaggerated and exciting. I particularly enjoyed the 6th episode with the crazy and eerie overnight shift. All in all I think that after reading the book this is about as perfect a representation of the material as can be made. I recommend the book and the series to anyone that works in a hotel or has ever stayed in a hotel. You will appreciate every episode for at least one of the subplots if not all of them. My only criticism is that the major story arcs that carry over from episode to episode develop a little slowly, but the payoff makes it all worthwhile. One more thing that I really enjoy is the soundtrack. It seems like the entire show is underscored with very nice music to help maintain the mood and create a perfect atmosphere to absorb you into every scene.","review\/time":"1205452800","review\/userId":"A2HUDDEJCGH1","tipo":"positivo"},

Bad Sound","review\/text":"This is a show about a posh hotel ... and it has enough scandal, sex and drama to satisfy any fan of British television. You'll need a region 2 DVD player to watch this. But those are easy and inexpensive enough to find. One of my favorite shows ever is Footballers Wives and although this show doesn't live up to that benchmark it still sizzles.One caveat is that the sound mixer for this show should be ashamed at themselves. The speaking track is low and muffled in many cases. The music track is booming and loud. It gets annoying because especially for an American viewer, it is hard to understand about a quarter of what is being said anytime there is music playing while characters are speaking. (which is almost always) This is one of the most poorly mixed shows I have ever heard in terms of the audio ... it is almost like someone made this on a laptop. The audio engineer really screwed this up. It makes the show very hard to watch because extremely hard to understand certain characters, especially when things are spoken in hushed tones or whispers. They put music (loungy heavy bass music behind the showe almost always.Beyond the terribly destructive audio, the show is interesting. The characters are ones you can invest in. A witchy manager, a slick assistant manager with a troubled and mysterious past, a lothario bartender, sexy cleaning lady, old school doorman, conniving ex-girlfriend front desk manager and a capable but somewhat shady concierge who steals the show. The guests who check into the hotel pose certain problems ... rockstars, suicidal guests, high class call girls. Each show usually focuses on 2 or 3 of these guests and their problems along with the drama between the staff. It is a good balance of humor and drama and each show is a nice escape where you can get involved in the plotlines and characters without suspending too much disbelief.The resolutions of the episode ... how they wrap up the storyline ... is usually pretty predictable and too cutesy. But this is a small part of the show. I made it through the first season and enjoyed it but to be honest, I don't know how many seasons I could invest myself in watching the same environment. Also, British luxury hotels are a lot different than luxury hotels in the USA. I can't help but think when I watch this how gaudy and cheap the hotel looks. It is supposed to be a creme de la creme top of the line luxury hotel ... however, here in the USA it looks sort of seedy and tawdry and not at all luxurious. Think lots of neon, grey and red. I think the set design does the show a dis-service ... but then again, I've stayed at a few hotels in the British style that were very expensive and very tawdry looking.Overall, a good show with interesting characters and sort of interesting storylines. I don't know how many seasons I could watch this ... but I guess Bad Girls focused on a prison and made it to 7 or 8 seasons. So we will see. Another good British drama with sexy story lines and plenty of plot twists. Anyone who can give me some recommendations on more British soap style dramas like this would be very helpful. I have seen all the Footballers Wives and Bad Girls. I am thinking my next show might be Mile High ... but would love a Brisith tv show in the veign of FBW. This is as close as I've come so far.","review\/time":"1358553600","review\/userId":"A35S32Y66WOM","tipo":"positivo"},

For the most part, I've enjoyed it a very great deal. The show provides a glimpse into a fictional five star hotel in London, which is a world that I'll never see behind from the perspective of an insider and probably won't see any time soon as a guest. While some of the capers and scams the staff and guests get up to seem a bit exaggerated for dramatic purposes, a lot of the stories do have some factual basis I'm sure.\"Hotel Babylon\" seems to me to be a sort of combination of the much more inferior (and wholesome) \"Love Boat\" (with the regular cast being \"the crew\" interacting with various passengers and their storylines) and the superior British series \"Hustle\" (about goodhearted British con artists). Stylistically, the series uses a lot of the same tricks that \"Hustle\" does (sped up action and other visual stunts).The cast is superior and unlike some I actually like the character of Anna (maybe because she's so pretty and has that sexy British upper class accent). The standout characters are Charlie, the super-concierge, and Max, the hotel manager.The plots are fun most of the time with one of the best being when an all star British soccer team visitsThe only major negative I would give the show is when they decide to have a plot that sends a sometimes overwrought political message:1. a preachy episode plot about illegal aliens featuring a heartless immigration inspector2. an episode plot featuring a Bosnian Serb war criminal whose resolution has the cast arguably colluding in a kidnapping and probably murder3. an episode plot that decries child labor in the fashion industryAnother fault is that the characters lie to each other an awful lot and I think that would pretty much erode trust and friendships.But overall, I'd say that if you can suspend disbelief some, it's worth \"checking into\" Hotel Babylon for a little fun.

Likewise, Dexter Fletcher saw much better days with Guy Ritchie. Except for the 'hard-nosed business woman', the women are self-serving bimbos that Las Vegas would be proud of, but all the characters are monochromatic and shameless stereotypes: unctuous Italian, gay black, trampy receptionist. The latter is also a consummate, if failed (due to stupidity), gold-digger who regularly sleeps with any good-looking guest who's rich enough. In fact, the whole place is run like a high-class brothel.These people supposedly work is a 5-star hotel in London, but their every action belies the 'invisible service' that one might expect in such an establishment. Week after week they bully, preach to, invade the privacy of, and otherwise interfere with the lives of high-toned clients. No one ever gets fired, no matter how egregious and selfish their behavior. It can be said that the characters and scripts display all the emotional maturity, and depth, of a ten year old. The episode in which the cliched straight Italian barman affects being gay (taught by the token gay black desk clerk) in order to get a big tip from a gay guest, is both embarrassing and offensive.Other reviewers find this series addictive. I, too, must admit that I watched the whole first series on a popular streaming service, but mostly in order to see if they could maintain such high standards of superficiality and questionable moral tone throughout. They did.At least I didn't suffer the humiliation of paying for it.","review\/time":"1252195200","review\/userId":"A2MLP4UGTF1R","tipo":"neutral"},

It had to be done and he did it. But, while this film is an artistically lush period piece and is conceptually intriguing, the realization is disappointing. The plot is somewhat muddled, the script doesn't justify its three and one-half hour length, and the characters are unremittingly stern---whereas, the hallmark of St. Francis was joy. (According to witnesses, he bore his year in prison \"with cheerfulness and good temper.\" A better interpretation of the saint's troubadour-like personality is the father's character in the Italian film \"Life is Beautiful.\")Additionally, Soavi's portrayal of Francis' relationship with the Catholic Church is slightly skewed and incomplete.Saint Francis was a reformer, not a rebel.In Soavi's interpretation, Saint Francis appears as a precursor to Luther; that is, Christianity should be \"sola scriptura.\" Add to that '\"sola\" nature' and '\"sola\"poverty' and you have the plot of this film in a nutshell. The Franciscan ideal does contain the Gospels, nature, and poverty, but it contains much more; obedience being high on the list. Saint Francis' faith was never at odds with the faith of the Catholic Church.Furthermore, belief that the Church did not allow men and women to read the Gospels in their native language is an erroneous belief, but it is widespread and one need not be anti-Catholic to hold it. This theme in the movie's plot is historically inaccurate. (What the Church guarded against were \"Gospels\" written in the vernacular that contained error. For those who are interested, Mario Derksen (Catholic Insight) in his essay, \"Did the Catholic Church Try to Keep the Bible From the Laity?\" uses modern and historical sources to argue that the Church was concerned with mis-translations, not translations.)For many good reasons Michele Soavi's film will (or, will not) resonate with viewers, but for an accurate picture of Saint Francis and Saint Clare one would do well to get a good biography. (G.K.Chesterton's \"Saint Francis of Assisi,\" is a start.)","review\/time":"1167696000","review\/userId":"A3R3TWZF2FVK","tipo":"negativo"},

I realize St. Francis's life was not a bed of roses, but there was almost no joy *AT ALL* in his life, according to this movie. Far too much crying for his character lines.Also, it was troubling to have St. Francis represented as someone almost bordering on disobedience to the Pope when he requests approval for his order.

Michael","review\/score":"2.0","review\/summary":"Very problematic depiction","review\/text":"Although visually sumptuous, gritty and sensual, this film has several problematic characteristics that prevent it from being either an enjoyable or edifying portrayal of St. Francis.In the first place, a_very_blatant Protestant plot element is inserted in the movie, with an apparent Waldensian St. Francis meets in prison. The man is there because he translated the Gospels into \"the common tongue\" and is then brutally tortured for such \"heresy\", but not before he passes his ragged Bible to Francis, whose faith is awakened by this first introduction to the Word of God.The second problem is that the movie does not attempt to attribute any sort of supernatural explanation to Francis' actions, but instead gives a naturalistic depiction of his life. God does not speak to Francis here. The closest we come to anything miraculous was when Francis and his brothers saw a large flock of birds. Even his stigmata is played down to resemble nothing more than scrapes on his hands. It is also hinted at that it is self-inflicted, since the movie earlier showed us Francis intentionally grasping a thorny stick as hard as he could, and wounding his hands.The third issue is that Francis' personality is just warped in this movie. He is portrayed as a delusional, self-harming, neurotic lunatic, an amiable simpleton at best. He is frequently shown crying, moaning, rolling around the ground in pain, spitting up blood. It is none-too-subtly hinted at that he was nuts.The fourth problem is that the movie is interminable. It is almost 3 hours long. If it contained any sort of plot development or dramatic tension, that would have been bearable, but with Francis mostly just acting strangely, it was not a pleasant experience.The movie isn't all bad, as I said. It is beautiful to watch, and so far as I can translate Italian, the acting seemed powerful to me. I was glad it didn't obscure Francis' faith, as Zefferelli's proto-hippy Francis seemed to do. However, the problems I elucidated above ruined it all for me.","review\/time":"1305763200","review\/userId":"A2B0DPQK20LY","tipo":"negativo"},

The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like \"The School for Scandal\" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what?

I've found","review\/text":"If all you care about is slick packaging and color video, by all means pass on to the thoroughly acceptable color DVD from the Broadway Theatre Archive, but if you want to see Richard Brinsley Sheridan's classic Restoration Comedy, THE SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL, performed by a theatre cast which would be hard to beat, this wonderful production starring a very young Joan Plowright and the always wonderful Felix Aylmer (don't miss him in the theatrical films of Bernard Shaw's THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA and SAINT JOAN) should be on your shelves. The smash hit 1963 Broadway production (recorded on Command Records) with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson *may* have surpassed this production for polish, but I have yet to see a film or video production which could.Sheridan's play premiered in London during the spring of 1777, and was playing in New York before the final shots were fired in our War For Independence. I'm having trouble finding the exact date of the broadcast documented in this Video Yesteryear release (and how I wish the packaging on more video releases from even more \"upscale\" releasers included such important information), but this video gives you the feel of what our founding fathers (and the British officers occupying New York for most of that war) must have enjoyed when it was new - the very graininess of the released film contributes to the illusion - and reminds us as effectively as the wonderful 1776 musical that they were actually flesh and blood people too.

Perhaps if the video allowed you to skip the segments or turn them off like the producer notes in movies, it would be a nicer experience.","review\/time":"1318982400","review\/userId":"ACYNXBW2IM4D","tipo":"negativo"},

Levie","review\/score":"4.0","review\/summary":"Nice compilation, but DVD could be better","review\/text":"This DVD is the \"Commemorative Collector's Edition\" of the *10 Years of Thomas & Friends* video that was released in 1999, and comes with a wooden Alfie vehicle by Learning Curve. It includes footage of the \"A Day Out with Thomas\" event held at the Strasburg Railroad in Pennsylvania, during which children selected their favorite episodes for inclusion in the video.Since the episodes contained in this DVD have been reviewed pretty thoroughly for the VHS version, I won't comment too much on them.Both the image and sound quality on the DVD transfer are fairly good. The DVD programming, however, leaves something to be desired. You cannot skip the logos and ads at the beginning of the DVD, nor forward through Sir Topham Hatt's introduction to the DVD features--at least, not on my DVD player (I was able to skip and fast forward using WinDVD on the PC).The \"Bonus Features\" are rather unexceptional. The \"Build an Engine\" game is best suited for young preschoolers: you add parts to Thomas, James, or Toby. The \"Sing-Along\" doesn't display the song lyrics, like on the \"Best of...\" DVDs, so singing along can be a challenge if you don't know all the words. The \"Read-Along\" story seems to be a scanned version of the storybook, and not very interactive, except for clicking on the arrows. The \"Character Gallery\" consists of brief bios of 16 engines, plus Sir Topham Hatt. And as for the link to the official Thomas website, well, you don't need this DVD to visit the site.Many reviews for the VHS version denigrate the footage from \"A Day Out with Thomas,\" but I actually enjoyed the footage of the Strasburg Railroad and life-sized Thomas. The interviews with children and parents, though, did grow tiresome after a few viewings. However, the \"Day Out\" footage actually was one reason I bought this DVD, since I planned to take my 2 year-old son to that very event at the Strasburg Railroad. I didn't want my son to be afraid when he saw the actual Thomas steam engine in real life, since it's a lot bigger than his wooden Thomas train!My son enjoys all the episodes, although his attention sometimes flags about halfway through the DVD, so we usually just watch a few episodes (right now, his favorite train DVD is *Big Trains, Little Trains*). It's a pretty good collection of George Carlin era episodes. My son couldn't care less about the narrators at this point, but my favorites have always been Ringo Starr and George Carlin. I used to watch \"Shining Time Station\" with my younger brothers back in the 80s. George Carlin does a great job characterizing the different engines and people.NARRATOR: George CarlinRUNNING TIME: Approximately 63 min. (plus 60 min.

Parisi \"Robert and Heather Parisi\"","review\/score":"5.0","review\/summary":"10 GREAT STORIES ON DVD + SING-A-LONG & A FEW SPECIAL FEATURES = 5 STAR ENTERTAINMENT","review\/text":"First of all, let me say that I love Thomas the Tank Engine. My 6-year-old son has loved Thomas for 3+ years running and I am very grateful for all the good times the three of us have had. That having been said, this is a compilation VHS. You will not find any new stories on this one. However, it is worth viewing (and getting, if you don't have a big collection) if you have children. We got this as a gift from friends, so having duplicates of the stories was not a big problem with us. Interspersed between the stories is what seems to be an advertisement for the \"Day Out With Thomas.\" It is interesting to watch, but is not informative for one actually thinking about participating in one of the programs.ABOUT THE STORIES:The 10 stories (4 more than the usual offering) featured on the video are as follows:Thomas & Bertie's Great Race: This is one of the formative Thomas stories and is a welcome addition to anyone's collection. This particular episode is referenced in several subsequent episodes.Old Iron: This is a charming story where Edward saves the day. However, this one is frequently recycled on Thomas' compilations. We already have it on at least 3 videos.The Trouble With Mud: Fans of Gordon the Big Blue Engine will appreciate this one. It is included on the Best of Gordon video as well.Terence the Tractor: This is another story which is essential to Thomas lore. Terence and his funny caterpillars save the day when Thomas get stuck in the snow. The song \"Don't Judge a Book by its Cover\" is based on this one.Percy's Ghostly Trick: This is a cute little story where Percy gets to play a little trick on Thomas.Mavis: This story features the lovely little diesel as well as an always-lovable Toby. Toby has to show impatient Mavis the ropes in this one.Henry the Elephant: The circus is on the Island of Sodor and the engines are always ready to be really useful, even when 5 tons of pachyderm are on the line. This is a charming story which is not on any of our other collections.Percy's Promise: Percy saves the day and does not let axle-deep water put a cramp in his style.James Goes Buzz-Buzz: We also have this episode on the Best of James collection, but it is a good story and features some nice stop-action animation as well as little-seen figures such as the Vicar.All at Sea: Duck wonders about life beyond the horizon in this lovely story. Harold the Helicopter puts aside his usual haughtiness to help him out. I've never seen this one, so it was a treat for my son and I.Thomas' Anthem Grand Finale: A rousing musical way to end a very well-spent hour on the tracks.George Carlin is the narrator for all 10 of the stories and he provides suitable voices for all the characters. I enjoy hearing him, although he is not as lovable as the quirky Ringo Starr.All in all, this video is well worth watching and would be a great way to start a new Thomas lover's collection. Check it out if you get a chance!ABOUT THE DVD:This one is a little short on features, but the transfer is exceptional. Since kids, like mine and perhaps yours too, will want to see this repeatedly, it is comforting to know that unlike the video, this DVD will not wear out as long as we keep the DVD out of harm's way.","review\/time":"1137974400","review\/userId":"A26HFSVLAGUL","tipo":"positivo"},

These are not just Thomas stories, but a mixture of episodes supposedly picked by children who went to the A Day With Thomas event in Penn. at some point. Preceding each story is a 40-second or so clip from the event, with parents and children commenting on the TV series. You cannot skip these with the skip button; you can fast-forward, but that's a hassle, isn't it? This is why some customers are understandably upset.But my two-year-old actually likes the footage from the event -- set to his favorite T&F; songs -- more than the stories themselves.

I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the \"in-laws\" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live \"Happily Ever After\". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage.","review\/time":"1335312000","review\/userId":"A2JOTVRQSHC7","tipo":"positivo"},

Rani Mukherji's role shows her as more serious about her career and her future, but Shah Rukh Khan's role shows him more nonchalant and maybe even a little bit lazy, and therefore, the relationship continues on a sour note.As far as the story goes, there is very little surprise here. I only really appreciate it more than many Bollywood films because, for once, I think the songs videos are more enjoyable than the movie itself.But, I generally watch Bollywood films because I love to watch good looking people on film. A good story is only secondary as my main intention is to be entertained.If you an English speaking American, and are new to Bollywood films, let me give you a breakdown of how I interpret and ingest the Bollywood experience:First of all, you will most always be reading English subtitles.The average Bollywood film is about 3 hours long.Bollywood films are very colorful. All their beautiful fashion, and colorful dance floors. In High Definition, just the sceneries alone make you appreciate what High Definition is all about.About 30 percent of the film will be music videos (with Yash Raj films, it's more like about 45 percent). I personally wish there were less music videos if the movie is already over three hours long.About 30 percent of most Bollywood films have some rather silly, really unfunny, and downright annoying comedy scenes (which is usually in the first half of the film), then the film will start to become more serious, as it moves along.One of the main reasons why you will watch a Bollywood film, is because you already chose to fall in love with one of their many beautiful actresses, or handsome actors. (I personally try to see all Rani Mukherji films, and Shah Rukh Khan is the one actor known to be one of the biggest box office sellers of Bollywood.)So, I guess I can honestly say that I have about 10 Blu-Ray Bollywood films which about 7 of them are Yash Raj releases. Though I have about 100 Bollywood films on DVD, all I really care to get on Blu-Ray now is \"Lagaan\" which was the first Bollywood film that I saw about 10 years ago. And perhaps \"Mann\" with Aamir Khan, and \"Rangeela\" which stars the enchanting Urmila Matondkar. Oh, and I guess it would be truly appreciated if \"Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai\" starring Amisha Patel and Hrithik Roshan would ever be released in High Definition Blu-Ray. The scenes in India and New Zealand were all just so beautiful on the screen.Another good movie that I would like to recommend, that is not a Yash Raj film, but is available on Blu-Ray is \"Ghulam\" starring Rani Mukherji and Aamir Khan. Even all the song videos in this film are all truly appreciated, and the added humor isn't so annoying. Check it out!","review\/time":"1321142400","review\/userId":"ACVFTS9X2MKJ","tipo":"positivo"},

About half way through, they often get more dramatic, and here is where you get the meat of the story. Chalte Chalte was no different. I liked this movie. I always like SRK and RM, but especially together. They have a great chemistry. I liked that neither of the characters is flawless. People aren't. We all have sides to us that aren't particularly likeable, but it's from there that we grow. Real love is taking the good with the not so good, and the relationship in this movie was believeable. I also liked the way it ended because people don't change overnight, old habits don't just disappear, although we may want them to, even desperately so. It takes time. I felt these characters would probably tackle their issues many more times in the future, but this round made them realize that they would have to work on it if they were going to stay together and make their dreams a reality.

I laughed at the silly misunderstandings. I cried (a LOT). Since then I've purchased many and loved most of them. Except this one. The first 30 minutes or so are as charming a Bollywood plot as any of the other movies. Poor boy sees rich girl, falls madly in love, follows her to another country, and woos her away from her family-approved wealthy fiance. Cute. But now there's 2 plus hours left of movie to go. And their relationship gets ugly. He can't get past her family's wealth and, though she never complains about their living situation, he's in a constant state of drama - scheming to succeed, blaming her when things don't go well...they split up, he makes a drunken scene outside her aunt's home.... Blah, blah, blah. As hammy as Shah Rukh Khan can be at times, he's never been unlikeable - until this movie. He was egotistical, arrogant, abrasive, annoying and I, frankly, wanted to reach through the screen and smack him.In short, if you want to dip your toe into the Bollywood ocean - and it's worth giving this genre a try - pick a different film.","review\/time":"1271980800","review\/userId":"A27HC7HYLI5Y","tipo":"negativo"},

However, there was no other redeeming quality to \"Chalte Chalte\" than what I've mentioned above.The love story is unrealistic from the beginning. That's usually okay in a romantic comedy because the characters still somehow live happily ever after, but this movie showed me that these kinds of relationships don't really work out. Okay, so this movie is realistic...but that didn't make it entertaining. The couple only got together because the man kept pressuring the woman to accept his proposal, and after they married, they bickered most of the time, mainly because of the husband's insecurities.This might be the movie for you if you're trying to watch every Shah Rukh Khan movie out there.

Priya (played by Rani Mukerji) is upper-crust, Raj (Shahrukh Khan) is working class; she's polished, he's brash; and the two make an irresistible pair who can't resist each other, despite a mountain of obstacles. They find a way to be together, of course, and that's where most romantic movies end--but here, that's only the first half. After they wed, they come down from the high of their dramatic courtship and discover marriage isn't all wine and roses. In addition to major personality clashes--they can't stand the qualities they once loved in each other--their different social backgrounds become a growing problem, and when Raj's business runs into financial trouble and Priya tells a well-meaning lie to help him out, he stands to lose his wife and his livelihood. Mukerji and Khan--who are frequent co-stars--have never been more in sync as actors and never more convincing as lovers, whether they're making each other laugh, cry, yell, or swoon. - The Bollywood Ticket: The American guide to Indian movies (Subscribe:The Bollywood Ticket)","review\/time":"1254009600","review\/userId":"A2UJG6T6DOWK","tipo":"positivo"},

I loved Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin is easily in my top five favorite comedies of all time. Also, I'm huge fans of Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen, so naturally this caught me by surprise.Whoever put together the trailer desperately tried to make it look like as much of a comedy as Apatow's first two films. I wasn't too excited to see the film because I didn't think it looked very funny. It's no wonder the comedic elements seemed scarce - it's more of a drama.One reason I am such a huge fan of Apatow's work, is that his films feel less like movies and more like real life. Nearly every single element of them could actually happen. This all stems from his passion for writing of his own personal experiences. Furthermore, all of his films are consistently relatable to one's own life in one way or another.In addition to his great writing, Apatow is a master at pulling real heartfelt feelings out of his entire cast and displaying them on film. Even when the characters are being funny or crude and vulgar, you can't help but believe this is exactly how they would act if the character were a real person.The movie shows us the dark side of a famous comedian and the rough underbelly of the world of stand-up. It also addresses how fame and fortune won't \"keep you warm at night.\" It's called Funny People and it's about comedians, yes; but I also sense a double meaning in the title as it goes to great lengths to expose how ridiculous people are in general.The story is centered on Adam Sandler's character, George Simmons. George is a huge comedic icon who has made several successful films with other well known celebrities. He lives in a huge mansion in L.A. and has more money than he knows what to do with. Sounds like he has the perfect life, right? Wrong.George finds out within the first five minutes of the film, that he has an illness and doesn't have very long to live. If that's not bad enough, we soon learn he virtually has no-one close to share this information with; no family, no friends, no-one.This is one of Sandler's best performances. There is a scene in about the middle of the film where he breaks down, loses his temper and makes a comment about how he pays for all of these things and none of them work; a play on words about his fame and success and how lonely it is. You really buy that he's a sad man who's made a lot of mistakes and owns them.We are constantly reminded of George's massive fame by all of the movie paraphernalia in the background, and his uncomfortable run-ins with fans. The film is also deliciously scattered with moments of real footage of Sandler's younger years in comedy and we get a few samples of his lyrical talent through humorous songs as well. George constantly makes jokes about how famous he is and how it's his job to entertain the world. However, it is evident that he is not happy with this.Upon hearing the unfortunate news, George decides to get back into stand-up. At a small comedy club, he meets Ira Wright, played magnificently by Seth Rogen.It's not very often that you see a comedian try to be less funny and that's Rogen's task here. He plays a young comedian who thinks he is funnier than he really is and Rogen nails it. He's normally the obnoxious and arrogant stoner who never really grew up and he plays that beautifully too; but here he is a sensitive guy with insecurities and a bitter awkwardness.George sees a bit of himself in Ira and hires him to write jokes for him. Ira's two roommates are funnier and more successful than him, so he jumps at this opportunity. His roommates are played by Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman.It's easy to tell that Apatow specifically writes parts for the actors he has in mind and it makes you appreciate the character that much more. The scenes with Ira and his roommates are classic and realistic of how young bachelors can be towards each other.Ira has been looking to further his life and is more than happy to spend less time at home with these two. Soon he and George hit it off and George hires him to be his personal assistant to do all sorts of things in addition to writing. Ira is the only person George can seem to communicate with and soon he lets him in on his secret.At well over two hours, you get a lot more out of a Judd Apatow movie, than you do most comedies. There is plenty of time to get to know all of the characters; especially in the director's cut, available on video. In addition to this, there are several different subplots happening simultaneously.We learn that George did at one time have a love in his life, but she is \"the one that got away.\" Leslie Mann plays George's ex-girlfriend Laura and he finds a way to get back in touch with her after several years. She is now unhappily married to another man who fathered their two kids.Mann and Sandler have great chemistry together, which is understandable as they have known each other for years and worked together in Big Daddy. Their characters hated each other in that film but here they share truly deep feelings that go way-back, and remind us of choices we made in our own pasts.Ira becomes George's wingman as he goes to visit Laura in hopes of winning her back.If you didn't know, Leslie Mann is the wife and mother of Judd Apatow's two kids, who play her kids in this film and in Knocked Up as well. Talent clearly runs through the Apatow family. I wouldn't be surprised if both of their daughters grow up to be stunning actresses just like their mother.Again, because of the real-life chemistry that all of these people have together, it only makes the scenes that much more genuine and enjoyable to watch. I'm sure Seth Rogen has gotten to know the Apatow family over the span of his career as well and Sandler and Apatow have been friends since before either of them became famous. There are some really nice moments in this section of the film and as if things weren't going well enough, they only get more interesting when the husband unexpectedly shows up.Eric Bana delivers one of the best comedic performances I have seen this year as Laura's obnoxious Australian husband, Clarke. You like him but you hate him at the same time. I learned that Bana is a big fan of comedy and did a lot of it in Australia and he has been waiting for the right opportunity to do more. What greater comeback could he have than an Apatow film?Eventually Clarke catches on that George is after his wife and the two get into a hilarious fist fight in the front yard. Sandler delivers one of the film's funniest lines in reference to him not being qualified to fight back because he's a comedian.It's so enjoyable to watch these movies. You laugh until you are blue in the face and you really care about the characters by the end of the film because you are so invested in them.Apatow is an amazing filmmaker. He perfectly maps out each character and every single scene is filled with wit and humor.Whether the movie is about losing your virginity (The 40-Year-Old Virgin) or having a child with the woman you love (Knocked Up) or trying to accept the fact that you let the love of your life slip through your fingers and you may die alone (Funny People); if it's an Apatow film, you know you will laugh and go on an emotional journey with the characters because we can all relate to them as people. Funny, isn't it?","review\/time":"1262908800","review\/userId":"ALLIGF5OZM1I","tipo":"positivo"},

It seems like it's going to be really entertaining, but ends up a bit anti-climactic. Then you slap yourself in the face for wasting that little bit of time and money in your life. Then, a few years later, you find that Slinky again and say, \"Hey, let me give this another shot,\" but get the same result. Then a few years later...well, you get the picture.So it's been with films like Punch Drunk Love and Click. They were good tries, but something always seemed to go wrong. Click was a little too vanilla, and took itself too seriously. Punch Drunk Love was too hard to follow to complete the full extent of the comedy. And yet, I can't not watch these movies if they randomly come on, whether it be on television or someone's DVD player.So when I heard that Adam Sandler was giving it another try with Funny People, I was a bit excited. I thought, \"Finally, he's gonna dooo it!\"Sorry.The previews showed the film to be a bit dark, but it was a Judd Apatow movie, complete with Seth Rogen and that fat guy from Superbad. This can't lose.And you know what? It didn't lose.The premise is relatively simple. Adam Sandler plays George Simmons, a stand-up comedian turned Hollywood mega-star. Upon learning that he has a rare and lethal disease, he begins a journey of deterioration to vent about his misfortune, without actually telling anyone about it. This leads to some very dark and unfunny stand-up acts. Seth Rogen plays Ira Wright, a fledgling stand-up comic who does open mic nights and sleeps on the couch of the apartment that he shares with Jason Schwartzman, who broke into Hollywood with a sitcom everyone loves to hate, \"Yo Teach,\" and Jonah Hill, who is on a little higher tier in the comedy world than Ira.Simmons hires Ira as a joke writer and personal assistant, and takes the young comic into the world of celebridom, with all of its quirks. A \"bromance\" seems to ensue, except on the occasion that Simmons reminds Ira that he just works for him when he's getting really crabby.The story, for the most part, flows fairly well. Those of us not in the limelight are able to perceive what happens behind that bright light that star comedians shine in, for better or for worse. The dramatic intent of Simmons' illness is also very well done. It is because of this foil that we truly care about him and the people he cares about. When we see how lonely Simmons is due to a lack of real relationships with real people, it tugs at the heart-strings. We also see the back-drop of the stand-up comedy world, which helps you appreciate it a little bit more. Granted, it was no Punchline with Tom Hanks, but it was good enough.The problem seems to be the romantic involvement. In the movie, Simmons contacts his old flame Laura, played by Leslie Mann. This in itself is not the problem. It helps steer the drama. The problem is that it drags on way too long. This movie is almost 2-1\/2 hours. About 20 minutes could have been cut from the climactic finale of the Simmons\/Laura story to keep the audience from falling asleep. Yes, it was that bad. Not bad enough to ruin the movie as a whole, but it sure came close.I think the comedy of the movie suffered because of this drag. Yes, I did laugh at quite a few scenes, but I seemed to have forgotten that I had laughed at all. References to the \"Yo Teach\" sitcom and the visits to the doctor's office were some of the most memorable.","review\/time":"1260230400","review\/userId":"A3TY1C8ZHY5T","tipo":"neutral"},

The second half you start to realize that George hasn't and won't change his ways. In other words, he's still a jerk. But believe it or not, this doesn't take away from the film too much. Adam Sandler is funny in his first R rated movie since way back in 1996's Bulletproof. Seth Rogen was funny but not as funny as he has been in previous roles. Not to say he didn't do a good job, it's just that that was the price to pay for being behind Adam Sandler.

It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama.

The problem with this movie is that it has too much going to have a consistent plot to it. The talents of Adam Sandler and Seth Rogen are totally wasted here. Jason Schwartzman, who I thought was entertaining in Fantastic Mr. Fox, also has his talent wasted here. The part with him being a TV actor on a show called \"Yo Teach!\" was laughably bad. Rza does provide some comic relief as Seth Rogen's co-worker at the grocery store deli, but the movie is far too horrible for Rza's comic relief to save this movie. The movie is far too long for a comedy or as I like to call it \"dramedy.\" Up In The Air is not even this long and it's a far better movie than this one. If you want an Adam Sandler movie that's part comedy and part drama, then check out Spanglish. That movie is not your typical Adam Sandler movie and succeeds where this movie fails.

It has some top comedy talent in the persons of Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, and director Judd Apatow (\"The 40-Year-Old Virgin\" and \"Knocked Up\"), but the movie looks beneath the veneers of men who make their living doing standup comedy, exposing some darker elements.George Simmons (Sandler) appears to have all that money can buy -- a beautiful home overlooking Los Angeles, a garage full of merchandise he's received free of charge just because he's a celebrity, and a never-ending collection of young women eager to jump into the sack with a star. But George has no significant relationship, no friends, and a rare, life-threatening disease.When he sees aspiring comedian Ira Wright (Rogen) perform at a comedy club, George asks Ira to write him some jokes for an upcoming corporate gig and eventually hires him as his personal assistant, partly as joke writer, partly for company.Though \"Funny People\" is only his third feature film as writer\/director, Apatow has established a trademark of creating natural dialogue and having his actors deliver it effortlessly. His ear for dialogue and flair for inventing colorful supporting characters makes his work stand out.This time around, however, Mr. Apatow has ventured into rough territory with a film about a comedian and his problems that's not very funny. We get glimpses of both Ira and George on stage. While it's understandable that Ira will be rough and unpolished, we expect that George will annihilate the audience with spot-on jokes and observations. This never happens. Instead, Apatow allows Sandler to mutter, utter a few lame gags, and mug as the on-screen audiences guffaw at nothing especially amusing.It's tough to empathize with Sandler's George. He has made his life what it is, becoming wealthy and famous in the process. Faced with the uncertainty of his illness, he mopes around, leaning on Ira in the absence of the usual support system of family and friends. He is desperate to connect, but can't.Mr. Rogen, slimmed down from his earlier movies, plays the struggling artist with integrity, a quality his wide-eyed-innocent face immediately conveys. Ira lives with roommates Mark Taylor Jackson (Jason Schwartzman), currently starring on a hit TV sitcom, and Leon Koenig (Jonah Hill), a sometime standup comic more proficient at making wisecracks with his pals than igniting audience laughter when he's on stage. This is a strange trio: three men living together even though one is being paid handsomely for TV work. But it allows the competitive pals to share their concerns, complain and moan, and air their views on the trials and tribulations of the comedy business. The chemistry among the three actors works well.Two other supporting actors deserve mention. As Chuck, fellow deli counterman at Ira's day job, RZA is very funny as a friend who will attend his coworker's standup gig only if paid to do so. This is a guy with perfect comic timing and a look to match. He's on screen for just one scene, but he steals it.Dr. Lars (Torsten Voges) is George's physician, who must convey sobering news to the comedian and outline the rigorous treatment he must face. As straight man to Sandler, he is a joy to watch, since he gets his laughs by staying in character and letting his appearance and Sandler's barbs create two first-rate scenes.Leslie Mann is on hand as George's former girlfriend, Laura, and Eric Bana plays Clarke, her Australian husband. Ms. Mann is a pleasant, attractive actress but has a tough role here. Married, with two children, her Laura is pitched into a situation of renewed intimacy with George, a development that pretty much sinks the film, reducing it to clich\u00c3\u00a9, predictability, and tedium.I have never been a fan of Adam Sandler's movies. As a sketch comic on \"Saturday Night Live,\" he was wonderful and portrayed many terrific, offbeat characters. But a little of Sandler goes a long way, and when he anchors a feature film, he often overstays his welcome. \"Funny People\" attempts to modulate his boyish hijinks and have him rise to a level beyond his customary celebration of male immaturity. \"Funny People\" accomplishes that, but the film itself is unremarkable.Rated R for language and sexual humor, \"Funny People\" is two hours and sixteen minutes, far too long. Scenes go on too long and several stop the movie dead. There are too many scenes of George hang-dogging it in his lonely hilltop mansion. Had some of these indulgent sequences been replaced with genuinely funny standup routines, the film would let the viewer see and hear the routines that made George Simmons a star.","review\/time":"1258416000","review\/userId":"A1KMG1AIUS00","tipo":"neutral"},

In certain ways, it's a dramatically audacious film, yet in others, Apatow comes back to the comfortably off-kilter humor of his previous ensemble efforts,The 40-Year-Old VirginandKnocked Up. Sometimes the balance feels very off here, primarily because the protagonist is so hard to read from the outside. It was inevitable that the director cast his former roommate Adam Sandler as George Simmons, a comic who has become a major movie star based on the type of juvenilia he constantly ridicules. Sandler accurately captures both the demented comedy mind and the innate cruelty that keeps everyone at arm's length. It's a tricky part that has quite a few autobiographical elements for both director and star, but he plays it with melancholic deftness.The meandering plot begins with George receiving bad news. He finds out he's dying of a rare blood disease and recognizes a need to reassess his priorities. George spots a struggling young comic, Ira Wright, at a local comedy club and hires him to write material and become his gopher. They bond quickly, and Ira becomes George's confidant, the only one who knows of his fatal diagnosis. Ira also has two roommates, another stand-up comic and an actor who has already caught his break starring as a teacher in a high school-set sitcom. Both become envious of Ira's budding relationship with George. Meanwhile, an old flame reenters George's life, Laura, a former actress who has turned into a suburbanite married to an Aussie exporter and raising two daughters in Marin County. Sparks are rekindled, and relationships start to get messy all around. As both writer and director, Apatow handles the situations dexterously but excessively. The film runs on far too long at a marathon 153 minutes and then simply trails off.Newly trimmed down, Apatow prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9 Seth Rogen plays his familiar dweebish persona as Ira, although he brings more depth to his submissive character with each humiliating act. Leslie Mann, Apatow's wife, has been promoted to leading lady this time as Laura, and she excels with her endearingly brittle style. In another justified act of nepotism, the director recruited their children to play the two precocious daughters. Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman play the roommates with their usual deadpan aplomb. The film's biggest surprise is the usually dour Eric Bana (Munich) lightening up quite a bit as Laura's suspicious husband. Cameos from well-known comics (Ray Romano, Andy Dick, Paul Reiser, Sarah Silverman, etc.) and even comic turns from the likes of Eminem and James Taylor are sprinkled throughout to give the film an air of Hollywood-style realism. The esteemed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski (Saving Private Ryan,Schindler's List) provides the film a bright, sharp look throughout.The two-disc 2009 DVD set smacks of overkill, but there are highlights to consider, chief among them the amusing commentary from Apatow, Sandler, and Rogen, in which they hilariously separate fact from fiction. The first disc also contains a four-minute gag reel. Disc Two contains 21 minutes of deleted scenes; six extended and alternate scenes; another gag reel; and a line-o-rama, a standard extra on Apatow's DVDs where the actors riff on the same lines for maximum comic effect. A lengthy, one-hour-plus video diary from the director is the centerpiece of Disc Two. Other featurettes center on Aziz Ansari's obnoxious stand-up comic; archival footage of Sandler and a thirteen-year-old Rogen; and a faux-documentary on George Simmons' film career. There are also music clips from Taylor, as well as Sandler performing with musician Jon Brion.","review\/time":"1259193600","review\/userId":"A13E0ARAXI6K","tipo":"neutral"},

Rosen","review\/score":"5.0","review\/summary":"Jake LaMotta would've made a hell of a comedian","review\/text":"Judd Apatow's Funny People is going to divide audiences (it certainly has divided critics). Those going in expecting a comedy along the lines of The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up or any other of the films in the Apatow-verse will enjoy it but not love it. But that reaction may be more a product of the misdirection in the marketing of the film than anything else. Funny People is going for something more emotionally complex, and it succeeds on that count.Without dwelling on plot, the film focuses, by and large, on the professional and personal lives of a group of comics and comic actors at various rungs of the show business ladder, from Adam Sandler's George Simmons, a hugely successful film comedy star who came out of the stand-up comedy world, to Seth Rogan's Ira Wright, a novice comic who is drawn into George's world, to Ira's friends, who are his roommates, who are his competitors.The common thread running through these characters is anger and aggression, both explicit and sublimated. They steal jokes, jobs and women from each other (listed here in order of importance to the comics). The relationship between the performers and their audiences is similarly complicated (it's become a cliched observation that comics talk about \"killing\" the crowd).Interestingly, although all the comedians share this anger and aggression, it's only those who ride those dark emotions into similarly dark comedy that have preserved their spark. The farther the comics stray from their anger, the worse their comedy - as evidenced by Sandler's character, who churns out family-friendly claptrap and co-star Jason Schwartzman's Yo, Teach!, a self-important sitcom (both brilliantly captured in clips woven into Funny People).In Funny People, comedy is the universal language by which these emotionally-constricted characters communicate. There are awkward hugs and half-hearted attempts at compassion, but the most tender moment, coming late in the film, involves one character expressing love by writing jokes for another.All this aside, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that this is a funny, entertaining, emotionally-involving film. But that said, in an odd way, Funny People echoes Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. Both films are about angry and aggressive people who channel those drives in socially acceptable ways. (Even more oddly, Billy Crystal's horrific and mawkish Mr. Saturday Night attempted more overtly to be the Raging Bull of comedy, and the less said about that effort the better.)It wasn't until the ride home from the movie that it occurred to me that the \"funny\" in the title Funny People could have two meanings; there's funny ha-ha, and funny-odd. Here, the people are intentionally, compellingly both.","review\/time":"1257033600","review\/userId":"A26SIA1G7KNJ","tipo":"neutral"},

But that doesn't mean that the film is weaker by any means. Yes, the film is flawed, it's too long, and draggy in parts. The last 45 to 60 minutes seem disjointed, compared to the first half of the film that focuses on Sandler's relationship with Ira, Seth Rogen's character.But it's also a very clever blend of comedy and drama, which is very difficult to put together in most contemporary films. I really believe this is Sandler's best role, a mature man filled with loneliness and regret. It's an honest examination of how far a man will go to correct all of the mistakes he's made in his life.Sandler is the star of the show, and anyone expecting the caricature that Dennis Dugan has created of Sandler should walk away. Sandler isn't doing Billy Madison, or Little Nicky here. This is Sandler playing a comedian with more depth.The relationship between Sandler and Rogen is explored really well. Of course, I would rather see Apatow focus the whole movie on their relationship, rather than his relationship with Leslie Mann, but at least you can't fault Apatow for his ambitious vision.The film bites off more than it can chew, but I really do believe it's one of the best comedies of the decade, and the highlight of Sandler's career.","review\/time":"1277856000","review\/userId":"A2XKQHB8VCUC","tipo":"positivo"},

A lot of people went into the movie thinking \"I'm gonna get to watch a hilarious comedy with some of the funniest people in the business\" when the film is just too real for that. Truly brilliant comedy does shine through, even from a somewhat cameo by Eric Bana (who spent the first 10 years of his career as a comedian), throwing in Bana was kind of a cool nod to the reference of him in Knocked Up \"If any of us get laid tonight it's because of Eric Bana\". But one of the things I enjoyed most was the whole life of a stand-up comedian from the big time to the small time, not to mention all the actors used we're real comedians.

Funny People is a bit of a departure from the formula established in the other two movies directed by Apatow. The end result is his most polarizing movie yet.Adam Sandler (Happy Gilmore, Billy Madison) stars as George Simmons. Simmons is a hugely successful comedian and actor who receives some bleak medical news early in the movie. This role was written with Sandler in mind, and his own film career somewhat parallels that of this character. After getting the bad news from his physician Simmons realizes that the last several years of his career have been incredibly unfulfilling.Seth Rogen (Pineapple Express, Observe and Report) is Ira Wright, a struggling comedian Simmons takes on as his assistant. Rogen lives with Leo and Mark, played by Jonah Hill (Superbad, The Invention of Lying) and Jason Schwartzman (Bored to Death, I Heart Huckabees) in excellent supporting roles. Schwartzman's narcissistic D-level actor who is very proud of his starring role in the hilariously awful Yo Teach...! steals every scene he is in. Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation, Mystery Team) is underused as a love interest for Wright. Aziz Ansari Parks and Recreation, I Love You, Man) shines as Randy, the hyperactive, raunchy comic who actually has a feature length film in development with Apatow. The supporting cast is definitely a strong point of this movie.This movie runs about 25 minutes too long, which is a real shame because it does a lot of things really well. Simmons and Wright go on a road trip to visit Simmons' ex-girlfriend who he still has feelings for. Apatow's wife Leslie Mann (17 Again, Knocked Up) plays Laura, and Apatow's two daughters play Laura's children. This entire final portion of the movie feels a bit like a tacked-on Apatow family showcase. Having said that, Eric Bana (The Time Traveler's Wife, Munich) plays Laura's Australian husband, and he does not disappoint in this rare chance to display his comedic chops.This release is loaded with special features. An unrated, extended cut of the movie is included along with the theatrical release. The unrated cut just extends some scenes and is entertaining but not too much of a departure from the theatrical release. It runs seven minutes longer than the original version. Two gag reels, deleted and alternate scenes, and a commentary featuring Apatow, Sandler, and Rogen are all included. Additionally, a feature called Line-O-Rama is outstanding as it features some of the movie's funniest scenes, with the actors ad-libbing punch lines rapid fire. There are four documentaries in this release, one of them chronicling the career of the fictional comedian Randy, played by Ansari. Another documentary is about Apatow's high school radio show that featured interviews with many famous comedians. The Funny People Diaries is a four-part documentary which delves into the filmmaking process.Funny People is a very polarizing movie. People I have talked to who saw the movie in theaters either love it or really dislike it. It has real characters and an engaging plot. Watching Simmons' relationship with Wright blossom over the course of the movie as he comes to terms with his own mortality is a real treat. Sandler hasn't looked this good in years. While full of humorous moments, it lacks some of the over-the-top hilarious moments that Apatow fans may have come to expect from his movies. However, this movie is extremely honest, and that is becoming more and more of a rare commodity.","review\/time":"1259366400","review\/userId":"A12JEY2PKSM1","tipo":"positivo"},

Same actors, same basic jokes, and even when Apatow tries to switch things into serious mode, as here, it all feels overly familiar.Rogen is likeable as always, as is Sandler, even when being a \"mean\" guy. Kinda hard to get involved with any of these characters, though. I did think this movie is made as much for other stand-ups as it was for the general public, so some of the inside stuff might be funnier than it seems. So, that's great for Apatow's pals' enjoyment, but reaction from the money-paying public to this flick is mixed at best, and I'd have to agree. Some funny moments make it worth watching, but in general it's too long and too scattershot. It's fine to try to dig deeper than the predictably successful Apatow semi-tripe, but it just doesn't add up to any sort of fulfillment here. But when you're making that much cash for everyone, they no doubt line up to lick your latest script.The best part is Eric Bana's brief turn; he's funny as hell here and reminds one how much fun a great performance can deliver. Sadly, he's the only real highlight. The lowlight was Apatow using his own kids and making us listen to one of them butcher \"Memories\"; clearly he's a proud Dad, but please. Puh-leeze! Is this a harbinger? If so, it was a great run, but you are now the Hollywood cliche you've made a fortune mocking, Judd.In short: worth seeing if you love these actors, otherwise, plenty of other films are worthier of your time.","review\/time":"1259366400","review\/userId":"A356RFKNIG04","tipo":"negativo"},

It was better than I expected. Back when it was in the theaters, I joked on Twitter that it should be called \"Funny\" People. While the observation underlying this criticism is indeed correct - that is, a dramatic representation of comedians misses the mark when the comedians fail to say things that actually make people laugh - there were enough dick jokes to give the story some verisimilitude. The only truly funny person in the movie is Jonah Hill, and following his character would have been way funnier than observing the golly-gee-shucks Seth Rogin be the bitch of the I-hate-everything Adam Sandler. Aziz Ansari is in it as well, and he plays a stand-up, but he doesn't do anything than anyone else couldn't have done. Also, Jason Schwartzman plays a womanizing sitcom actor; I think that he has forgotten that he got famous by playing Max Fisher and instead he thinks that he was Jordan Catalano.The business about Adam Sandler's character being diagnosed with a terminal illness left me neither shaken nor stirred. It might be that he is too abrasive to elicit sympathy, or, more likely, his wealth, which the movie showcases gregariously, makes it impossible for the audience to really pity him, no matter how much his character is desensitized to how awesome it is to be rich and famous. His wealth and his fame - and the women that wealth and fame get him - form the basis of Seth Rogin's character's admiration of him, which is sad, because I would hope that an aspiring stand-up would seek to emulate a comic celebrity because that celebrity is particularly funny, not because he has a big house, a fancy pool, and extra televisions on the wall (BTW: Is this something that people are doing now? Are they putting three or more televisions up on their living room walls? This movie is the first time I've seen this phenomenon, except, of course, for Back to the Future 2). Still, despite whatever down side there might be, being rich and famous is just great. I don't care what this movie says.The part of the plot that matters is the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Leslie Mann's character. Long story short, they used to be in love, but, after he cheated on her, they went their separate ways, and she went on to get married and have a couple of kids (played by Apatow's and Mann's real-life daughters). Early on, we learn that they are still in love. Thus, the real tension of the movie is whether or not these two characters will end up together - that is, whether or not Mann will leave her husband for Sandler. - spoiler alert - She doesn't, and I'm glad she doesn't. The main message of the movie, then, is that past relationships, while they are important in shaping our present selves, and while they are sometimes heart-warming to reminisce about, must remain in the past. There is no future for past relationships, and that is how it should be.The other nice aspect of the plot is the gradual growth of Seth Rogin's character, as he loses his golly-gee-shucks admiration for Sandler's character, and he eventually learns to see people as people and to stop feeling starstruck, subservient, and second class.Compare this film to the documentary The Comedians of Comedy, and you'll see clearly that Rogin and Sandler are merely actors. The movie suffers from the same problem that undid Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip. Namely, you can't use exposition to tell an audience that someone is funny; the person has to actually be funny.Lastly, the movie is quite long. I've not checked to see exactly how long it is, but it definitely feels long. I credit the movie's length to something I call \"The Rowling Effect\": when an author is just starting out he or she is heavily edited, but, after the author gets famous, he or she can go on and on interminably (that's why the Harry Potter books got progressively longer and longer). Similarly, now that Judd Apatow is well-known, there's nothing to stop him from cramming everything into a movie that he wants to cram into it.","review\/time":"1259193600","review\/userId":"AE99V8AKE2JJ","tipo":"neutral"},

The Blu-ray transfer is gorgeous, which is very important because the producers have taken great lenghts to photograph the film in a very cinematic way. This is not a typical script with predictable motivations and predictable story development, it has an original voice and at 2 and a half hours, it takes itself quite seriously.I don't give away plot points in my reviews, I just share key factors of the films' strengths, as per example the way it's filmed and the way the story is told. Funny People succeeds on all counts and at the same time is one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see! This is a journey worth taking in the world of movie-making and definitely Adam Sandler's best performance and the most interesting character he's ever played since the film SPANGLISH. Also a very juicy part for Eric Bana in a supporting role that he conveys with great energy and will be remembered for years.","review\/time":"1284163200","review\/userId":"AHPCWHAKOVZX","tipo":"positivo"},

However, what the movie lacked in humour it made up for it with intriguing characters, a twisted plot, and a touching drama.The story of a comedian facing his demise is something of a cruel joke and Adam Sandler plays the character well. He alternates between being a great, friendly, likeable guy and a disenchanted, grumpy jerk. I think this is one of Adam Sandler's best and most complex roles sincePunch-Drunk Love (Two Disc Special Edition) (Superbit Collection). Seth Rogen and Leslie Mann also deliver great supporting roles to help flesh out the movie. The bit part played by Jonah Hill is also endearing.While Funny People makes an interesting drama it starts to drag its heels towards the end and the movie could've probably been twenty minutes shorter and just as good. The amount of the time and the depth dedicated to the romantic subplot between Leslie Mann's character and Eric Bana's character is a bit unnecessary. I get that they're married and that it poses a problem, but I don't need the details and those details didn't add much, if anything, to the movie. (And frankly, it couldn't have been that important to the movie since I don't even remember those characters' names.) The movie is best at the beginning and when it sticks to the main storyline of George's eventual demise.I'd recommend this film to Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow fans as well as viewers who enjoy dramas. If you're looking for laugh-out-loud moments and non-stop jokes, this isn't the movie for you. But if you're a fan of films likeJuno (Single-Disc Edition)and other uncomfortably-awkward movies, this might just be the movie you need to watch.I was happy this movie was a rental and not one I had purchased. It's not something I'd enjoy watching repeatedly, or pull out again on a sick day to watch, but it is worth renting and watching once.","review\/time":"1270166400","review\/userId":"A1M7Y63Y5GYJ","tipo":"neutral"},

The movie is pathologically unfunny. It is so unfunny, it is very hard to tell where the humor is supposed to lie. Instead, the movie is a bleak yarn about stand-up comedians whose material is... supposed to be funny, apparently, judging by title and by the tittering of the comedy audiences in the movie, who constitute a kind of living laugh track. But I cannot begin to fathom what is supposed to be funny about this material. \"If the guy from MySpace (big MySpace logo in background, clearly a product placement) and the guy from Craigslist got in a fight, I wonder who'd win.\" This is one of the \"jokes\" in the movie that is supposed to be funny. Then James Taylor features in the movie as a kind of commercial for himself, to no purpose whatsoever. The only way I could make sense of this movie is as an anti-comedy: a movie that is supposed to be funny only because it is so completely unfunny. However, this subtle type of humor is rarely intentionally perpetrated. But if you want some genuine anti-comedy stand up material, here it is:(COMEDIAN GETS UP ON STAGE, COMES TENTATIVELY TO MICROPHONE) \"Uhh... hi.

Okay, well, I guess I could ask now who DOESN'T think speeding things up makes them funnier... but then I already know the answer, don't I?

It's also one of the most vulgar films in the ever growing long list of Sandler movies.I swear the entire first half of Funny People had absolutely no storyline whatsoever. Even the way the film begins is honestly just a bunch of pointless nonsense. It consists of nothing but highly offensive stand-up comedy routines at night clubs involving the main characters, but the amount of crude humor becomes so tasteless that the entire first half of Funny People ends up being nothing but a big distraction.At least the film improves by actually GOING somewhere during the second half- we find out that Adam Sandler had a girlfriend a long time ago, and he wants to be with her again. Unfortunately for him, the woman has a family now, but he tries to win her over anyway (even though her Australian husband doesn't care for any of Sandler's nonsense one bit).Funny People is also quite offensive in that Adam Sandler's character is supposed to be a portrayal of someone who is sick with a deadly disease (leukemia) and yet, if that were the case, then why in the world are all those disgusting sexual references *still* taking place? Wouldn't a person dying of a disease, you know, STOP acting like an immature disgusting weirdo every second of the day? I realize this is supposed to be a completely fictional comedy, but still, it's not realistic in the slightest.So to put things into perspective, Adam Sandler doesn't do a particularly good job portraying a sick person because in reality nobody would act that way if they were really dying of a horrible disease. People with leukemia wouldn't find this movie funny at all, and rightfully so. Weird.So basically the first half of the film is nothing but a terrible display of really crude humor as part of frequently stand-up comedy performances from the main characters, and the second half -while still pretty disgusting and inappropriate for anyone under the age of 18- at least delivers with a typical SOMEWHAT satisfying Adam Sandler performance (he's not exactly my favorite actor of all-time, either).I can't recommend this film to anyone, really. It's not a quality movie, the humor is highly inappropriate and disgusting for the majority of it, and the storytelling suffers from taking WAY too long to actually get going. I'm disappointed in Adam Sandler even going along with something like this.","review\/time":"1277510400","review\/userId":"A2582KMXLK2P","tipo":"negativo"},

Funny People, his third film as writer\/director, gave me considerably high expectations, especially with the talent behind and in front of the camera. I saw the film as possibly being a return to form for Adam Sandler, who hasn't made a well-written, original, or truly funny comedy in some time now. Funny People is not a typical Apatow comedy and is an example of the director broadening his range as a filmmaker. Despite the title, this is much more of a drama than a comedy and is easily Apatow's most mature effort as a filmmaker.The film opens with actual footage of Sandler making prank phone calls when he and Apatow were roommates. It quickly changes gears and introduces us to George Simmons (Sandler), a famous stand-up comedian diagnosed with AML, a blood disease similar to leukemia. George doesn't have much longer to live and he's got no one to help him cope with it. He has a large mansion overlooking Los Angeles and he's recognized in public all the time, but George lacks any real human connection. Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) is an aspiring stand-up comedian who isn't very funny, but George sees him at a club, likes him, and commissions him to write jokes for him. George latches onto Ira for emotional support, while never really letting him in to his life. Their relationship is summed up with George's line \"I don't have a best friend. You're my best friend and I don't even like you!\" As George struggles with his mortality, he reconnects with Laura (Leslie Mann) the one he let get away, now married with two children.The film also stars Jonah Hill and Jason Schwartzman, as Ira's roommates and is littered with celebrity cameos (the most amusing being Eminem and Ray Romano). Funny People runs about 140 minutes and this bloated running time gives Apatow a lot of material to fit into the movie. While I applaud the man for trying something different, he has a lot of room to grow as a dramatic filmmaker and there are moments of this film that it seems he's taken a few steps back as a comedic filmmaker. The movie has scattered scenes of stand-up comedy that are really, almost ridiculously unfunny. Initially, this made sense as a way of illustrating the fact that Ira isn't particularly funny...But every scene of stand-up comedy, including those with George Simmons weren't funny. And I don't just mean that the comedic style didn't appeal to my comedic palette, I mean the jokes are horribly un-funny and poorly written. They are jokes that sound like they were written by teenagers and there doesn't seem to be a reason why they're so bad. There's nothing smart or witty about any of the jokes in the stand-up scenes. If this was intentional, I stand by my reservations about the jokes because how often did Apatow have to subject us to un-funny scenes of stand-up?There are some strong performances in this film and you see several of them growing as actors. Seth Rogen is not far removed from his usual role, but he is certainly trying to play a different character here. He has a smaller physical frame, yes and sideburns which should've been given screen credit, but this performance is much more human than his performances in other films. Sandler has been showing lately that he's very effective in dramatic roles and he brings moments of genuine pathos to his performance as George Simmons. I don't think Apatow fleshed-out Simmons as much as he could have, but I did get the feeling that Sandler is more like Simmons than other characters he has played. Jason Schwartzman (who also does the music for the film) abandons the quirky, sarcastic character he usually plays for the quietly arrogant wannabe actor. It's hardly a big change, but it's nice to see him playing something slightly different. Finally, in a film with some very funny people it is Jonah Hill and Eric Bana that really bring genuinely funny moments to the film. Hill has a comedic style he brings with him from film-to-film, but his awkward, shy sarcasm brings some much-needed humor to the film when you don't expect it. Bana is the real surprise as Laura's Australian husband Clark and his performance is the most memorable and certainly the highlight of the film.What could have really salvaged this film is a rewrite of the script or some editing. The script isn't bad, but it doesn't seem like Apatow wrote more than one draft and he could have taken more time to flesh out his characters and find a better story arc. Editing, at the very least, would have drastically helped this film and if the plot had focused more on the internal struggle of George Simmons it could have brought the filmmakers some awards. I found the first scene with Sandler and Mann together worked very well as a drama. There's a sense of realism and plausibility to the idea that the two are former lovers who still have strong feelings for each other. The scene is very subtle, there are no dramatic exchanges and it was this scene that showed me how Apatow could one day be a very good dramatic filmmaker, but he's got a little more to learn.The film's biggest flaw is really its running time and, from someone who has nothing against long movies; this movie is way too long and I'm not entirely sure what Apatow intended people to take away from Funny People, nor am I entirely sure what his intention for the film itself was. It's not meant to be hilariously funny, but it never quite takes itself seriously enough to be taken seriously as a drama. Funny People is not a horrible film, although many will think it is just like Sandler's other ventures into drama haven't been looked on with affection. However, mature or not, this is Judd Apatow's weakest film and will have the shortest shelf-life of the films he has made thus far.GRADE: C+","review\/time":"1259020800","review\/userId":"A34D06JL7LC6","tipo":"negativo"},

Were those supposed to be jokes that they were telling?Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting any \"why did the chicken cross the road jokes\", and I knew that because the movie was rated R, there would be plenty of crude body jokes, but come on! Rogan's character's jokes revolved only around his \"manliness\" and farts. Even Sandler's character pointed out that Rogan would never get a girl if he kept talking about things like that. I personally got so tired of the repetitiveness of Rogan's jokes that whenever he got up to perform, I would zone out and start paying attention to the people sitting around me because, honestly, they were more entertaining than what I had paid nine dollars to go and see.When it got to the second half of the over 2 hour long movie, the \"funny parts\" disappeared completely.

A tender, profound, truly moving and deeply human story that has a great abundance of depths, it is also often indeed very funny. A story about a rich, successful, comic actor who has lost himself (or never found himself) it deserves to be a major global hit, and I suspect the only reason it isn't is that it is if anything too perceptive and subtle for the market at which it seems to have been intended. The script is witty, endlessly inventive, the direction and the story itself give you a sense of watching a slice of life more than a heavily plotted tale (though don't worry, there is plenty of story going on). The acting is wonderful: Adam Sandler is a joy to watch, very moving, compelling and funny too. Seth Rogen has a great chemistry with him and is perfectly convincing as an ambitious yet a genuinely caring employee and friend. Leslie Mann is the emotional core of the film just as she was in '17 Again' and her character in 'Funny People' is a deep and convincing portrayal of a woman who to some extent is as lost as the Sandler character. The supporting performances are wonderful: the two daughters of the Leslie Mann character (in fact Leslie Mann's kids in real life) are extremely accomplished young actresses, and the other support performances are all tremendously good.Well done to everyone concerned for making a truly remarkable movie that will repay repeated viewings.Eminem has a very good cameo in it by the way.","review\/time":"1275696000","review\/userId":"A2FPTKHLSR8Y","tipo":"positivo"},

Wilkerson","review\/score":"4.0","review\/summary":"Funny People","review\/text":"Judd Apatow has made a name for himself in producing and directing amazingly hilarious, raunchy R rated comedies. While he's had a long career which includes the well reviewed and prematurely cancelled TV shows Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared, his name really came into prominence when he produced the movie that launched the leading man career of Will Ferrell in the 70's newscaster spoof Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. In 2005 he directed his first feature film launching the movie career of Steve Carrell with the movie 40 Year Old Virgin, a movie I count as my favorite comedy, and list in my top 10 favorite movies of all town. After that he launched Seth Rogen's career in the superb Knocked Up, Jonah Hill's career with Superbad, and Jason Segel's career with Forgetting Sarah Marshall my second favorite movie in the bunch. With Funny People, Apatow adds Adam Sandler, Jason Schwartzman, Eric Bana, and even Eminem to the mix. The question is, how did it stand up?Funny People is the story of George Simmons (Adam Sandler), a superstar comedic actor with many hits under his belt, and is beloved superficially by almost everyone. In reality he is a troubled, loathsome, lonely man who doesn't allow anyone to get to close, and those that do he drives away. After being diagnosed with an advanced blood disease similar to leukemia, George realizes just how lonely he is and decides to start doing stand up again. Enter in Ira Wright (Seth Rogen). Ira is a struggling stand up comic, who does stand up for free at improv nights, works at a deli, and lives on the sofa sleeper of fellow comics Mark Taylor Jackson (Jason Schwartzman, also doing musical duties behind the scenes for the movie) and Leo Koenig (Jonah Hill). After seeing Ira's stand up one night, George Simmons hires him as his writer and personal assistant, aka his best friend. Through out the course of the movie we see George Simmons trying to reach humanity again. As he comes to the realization that he's dying he reaches out to friends and family he hasn't been in contact with for years, and tries to reclaim love with his former fiancee Laura (Leslie Mann, Judd Apatow's wife) who is now married to a philandering Aussie named Clarke (Eric Bana), and now has two children Mable and Ingrid (Maude and Iris Apatow, Leslie Mann and Judd Apatow's real life children).It should really be said that Funny People is not as completely a comedy in the way that 40 Year Old Virgin or Knocked Up are comedies. Funny People is a much more naked, emotional affair than either of the previous movies. That's not to say that the film is not funny, it has more than it's fair share of comedy, bringing in many superstar comedians including Dave Attell, Ray Romano, Sarah Silverman, Norm MacDonald, Andy Dick, etc. There's also some great stand up to be seen from the likes of Jonah Hill, Seth Rogen, Aubrey Plaza (who steals nearly every scene she's in as Daisy), and of course Adam Sandler. Seeing the inner workings of comics and funny people trying to break their way into the business, and their interactions with each other gives our characters and the writer a lot of comedic material to mine, and they mine it well.Comedy is not at the forefront of the this movie though. In reality, the movie is about finding life in the midst of death, and to that end the writing and the acting is superb. As a dying comedian trying to find his humanity, Adam Sandler finds a funny and serious streak unlike just about anything we've seen him in. While we've seen him do serious before in Punch Drunk Love, Reign Over Me, and Spanglish this is arguably the best performance he's given so far, mixing in the old Adam Sandler we've seen in Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison with a much older and mature Sandler. Seth Rogen, also does a much different role than that of the pot smoking slacker schlub than what we're used to from him. Playing a confidant, assistant, and writer for Simmons, Rogen plays Simmons last link to humanity and his conscience. Seeing both of these characters somewhat out of their element and playing the characters amazingly well is a very nice change of pace.For all it's strengths, there is one major weakness: running time. At 146 minutes, Funny People can drag a little bit in the more serious dramatic areas, especially when you really want more of the strong comedic material you've seen throughout the movie. In all honesty though, I couldn't tell you what should have been cut to make it shorter. The arc of George Simmons really needed the running time to help flesh out the characters. All in all, I would say that Funny People is a great movie definitely worth seeing, if not in the theater, definitely on DVD where you can get up and move around when you feel like it.4.5\/5","review\/time":"1260316800","review\/userId":"A2OU415LB9I5","tipo":"positivo"},

Therefore, he reflects back on his life makes amends and chases the girl that got away with the help of new assistant, a thin Seth Rogen.Yes, it is what we hipsters would call Narm city. Yet this Judd Aptow directed flick is so self aware of the pitfalls that it not just avoids them for the most part but in a true stand up comic style calls them out. This is at its heart a very smart and aware film. What could have been Terms of Endearment with dick jokes turns into an occasionally funny and somewhat touching film. It is also a very real film about real people and I am going to repeat myself here but it is truly smart.The only real downside I see is that I really do not see myself watching this film again anytime soon. It is a great ride but it never reaches that next level. The movie consists of some very funny bits, but do not come aboard expecting belly laughs. In addition, while I found myself enjoying the laid back pace at 153 minutes there is no question this feels more like a directors cut than a tightly paced theatrical release.","review\/time":"1259452800","review\/userId":"A28GCEHD00JF","tipo":"positivo"},

Supposedly Adam Sandler was his former roommate and the film's opening scenes show them making crank calls to people.Adam Sandler plays George Simmons who is a top stand up comedian and revered by young aspiring comics because of that he is disconnected from reality and does not have a real friend. He lives surrounded by yes-men and a lot of women. Suddenly he is diagnosed with a fatal disease which is similar to leukemia. George Simmons meets a struggling comic Ira Wright aka Ira Weiner (Seth Rogen) at a local club and hires him to do his writing and become his almost live-in attendant for 1500 dollars a week. Ira is not so funny and has been struggling a lot so he quickly takes up the offer much to the chagrin of his roommates (Jason Schwartzman & Jonah Hill) who had been moderately successful till Ira landed this job.Ira gets to travel with George and gets to experience firsthand the privileges that come with success and also face the tantrums and mood swings that successful people are expected to have. Ira does a good job despite being humiliated constantly by George Simmons. Unexpectedly an old flame - the one that got away enters George's life again, Leslie Mann, she still loves him but she is married.Seth Rogen as the assistant Ira delivers a great performance as the submissive, yet helpful attendant to George Simmons. I thought the performance was great because he could have been pathetic in many scenes but is not. I have not seen many Adam Sandler movies but this was great acting as he played it with such great care. In my opinion, the role of a dying man who is famous and does not have any friends could have been a flop, but Sandler does a great job. Leslie Mann as Simmons former girlfriend is good as someone who is caught between old love and the security of a family with children. Eric Bana is the surprise of the movie- Loved him as the obnoxious husband to Leslie's character. The movie tries to offer a realistic portrayal of a standup comics carrer and has been strewn with appearances by many celebrities such as James Taylor, Aziz Ansari, Sarah Silverman, Ray Romano, Eminem (Hilarious) The music is great and has great tunes by Lennon & Warren Zevon. I am thinking of buying the soundtrack. This is not the best movie you can watch but it is still watchable considering it is almost 2 hours and 26 minutes long.

Because of this diagnosis he decides to go back to his stand-up comedy roots and does a bitter and depressing impromptu set at The Comedy Club, which is where he got his start. While there he sees Seth Rogan, a newbie comic starting at the bottom of the ranks and working in a deli during the day. Sandler likes Rogen's set and asks the Rogen character to write jokes for him and be his assistant.The movie is fairly raunchy, both in the stuff that happens in the lives of the characters, and in the material they use on stage, so if you're easily offended, stay away. As a once-upon-a-time aspiring comedian, however, I found the look into the lives of beginning and old-time comedians educational. It felt to me that this is the way it probably is for a lot of comedians. There are Rogen's comedian roommates, Johah Hill and Jason Schwartzman, the latter having a lead role in a B-level sitcom (Yo, Teach!), the fame of which he uses to screw everything that moves (though he has a 10-day rule to give Rogen a chance, which makes me laugh, just thinking about it). Sandler has the same propensity for using his fame to his sexual advantage, which is probably why at this stage of his life he has no family and no friends, friend being another thing that could be added to Rogen's job description.There are tons of cameos including one by the glasses-wearing, Eminem, who bullies an innocent, just-standing-in-line Ray Romano.So, get it if you're a fan of stand-up or any of the actors (Leslie Mann is Sandler's old flame and Eric Bana is her new husband). Stay away if you're offended by lots of swearing, raunchy jokes and behavior, and an over-all lack of morals by most of the characters.","review\/time":"1274659200","review\/userId":"A11ZESNK9JXT","tipo":"negativo"},

That being said there are certain things known to be different from Sandler and his character, but you do wonder how he feels about the negative aspects of fame and fortune. I would say most of those things are true for him, but he enjoys it more. The other younger characters are there to show you the way it is from the ground up and Apatow has interesting things to say about it. Jason Schwartzman's character says so much about ambiguous nature of fame that's out of your control. He's made a rich man by doing clearly bad work, created by bad writers, but in the service of supposedly being hip and socially conscious. What's he to make of it, though, when he's rewarded for being terrible and consenting to it. It's hard for people who even recognize this, to not become conceited and that's exactly what happens. The film makes an interesting rumination on things people hardly consider when trying to make it in show biz, you take what they give you, not necessarily what you want. Technically, it makes that statement about life as well and for those who don't find it funny even though it does achieve that, if you go back it does make that statement repeatedly.

It is very, very good, emotionally satisfying, funny on a number of nicely nuanced levels, and best of all, a film aimed directly at grownups. Of course, anybody who's watched a film from the Apatow cabal with anything like a discriminating eye will have noted a consistent theme--underneath the extremely crude sexual and scatological humor, male bonding and fantasies of perpetual adolescence lies a call for responsibility, wisdom and discretion. Very cannily, Apatow recognizes his audience and doesn't disappoint; he draws in the beer and bong crowd with the promise, always delivered on, of rude hijinks and memorably pornographic dialog, then delivers the medicine. Boiled down, his message is this: Grownup can be sexy, fun and tonic too. His male point of view characters begin as feckless kids and, somewhere along the line, don the mantle of responsibility and adulthood along with the love of a good woman. Ultimately, Apatow's vision is a conservative one, made easier to digest with gallons of silly fun.In this one, Adam Sandler's character George Simmons, a highly successful comedian, has a near-death (or maybe that should be near-life) experience. Living the high life without ever really touching other lives in a meaningful way, he's adapted himself to the cocoon of fame, with all the attendant glories (groupies, tons of tuff) allowing him to stay insulated from real emotion. Then he finds out he has a rare blood disease, a form of leukemia, comes to terms with \"the one that got away\" (the always-lovely Apatow regular Leslie Mann) and his family. With the help of Seth Rogen's Ira Wright, a struggling, up-and-coming comedian, he discovers himself, deepens, and gains perspective. I won't rehearse the rest of the plot; all I will say is, this movie will last a long time. Long after the beers and bong hits have been downed, Funny People will continue to resonate in adult hearts. It's a bittersweet valentine to the profession of comedy and a heartfelt, smart tribute to the virtues of growing up. Apatow's stable of actors display dimensions you've rarely seen them portray.

I was going to dismiss this flick as a noble failure but something about it resonated in my self-conscious. My main gripe was that the film's main character, George Simmons(Adam Sandler), was an overbearing narcissistic heel. But it dawned on me that this was purely intentional and that Apatow and Sandler are taking a leap in expecting their audience to accept this reality. This is a hard film to like but ambitious viewers should admire what Apatow is attempting here. In this epic of sorts Apatow gives some choice parts to the immensely talented Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill and they run with it. It's kind of like Sandler is passing the torch or at the very least sharing the spotlight with these newcomers. Debits here are possible overlength, too much scatalogical humor, and a touch of nepotism in the casting(Leslie Mann, Apatow's wife, and his two daughters are prominently cast. Lot's of delicious cameos my fave being Ernest Thomas, \"Raj\" from \"What\"s Happening\" as a television school principal.","review\/time":"1265500800","review\/userId":"A2B73CL3QSYW","tipo":"positivo"},

I felt like I was getting a different look into the world of comedy. Adam Sandler does a great job of portraying a cynical, cold, veteran king of comedy who has had it all and done it all (not too much of a stretch). The supporting cast is pretty good, and the comedy within the movie seems real enough, but I really enjoyed Sandler's performance for most of the movie. The only problem I have really is the fact that for me the buildup and climax of the movie was the weakest part of the film - a little boring and overdone, though it ended strong afterward. I found Seth Rogen to be good in some scenes but also boring in others - he seems better suited to play a more raunchy and cynical character himself rather than the relatively innocent guy he tries to portray here.This is half drama and half comedy, not a \"mainstream\" type of movie, but Sandler's performance anchored the film and I recommend it.Oh and - minor spoiler here - I absolutely love that the late, great Warren Zevon's \"Keep Me In Your Heart\" is the one song that broke through George's veneer.

He did great at acting in \"8 Mile\", but what he doesn't seem to know is that it was a one time deal!!!!-Too many [...] jokes.-The movie was so depressing that how it got called a \"comedy\" beats me. Is this seriously the best Apatow has to offer after stellar movies like \"Anchorman\" and \"Pineapple Express\"????-Too long for what it was, but not long enough for the amount of material crammed into it. The movie basically ends at like 1 hour and 40 minutes, however the rest seems like a 45 minute after-the-credits sequence but placed before the credits. I am not lying, I thought it was over so many times. It was like the movie ended and the sequel already began.-It's not a movie, it's a drinking game. Adam Sandler makes a [...] joke? Take a drink.

'Funny People' is a (very) full-bodied (and smart) DRAMA first and foremost but without ever voiding the plot of Apatow, and Sandler's, comedic sensibilities which are still seen and felt throughout; still a FUNNY movie underneath it all. I call it Apatow's BEST film and it's quite a shame it actually LOST money at the box office! Perhaps it's the way the film was advertised or the expectations movie-goers had going into it; or maybe even the LENGTH of the film. To those who say it 'went on too long' SO don't appreciate the artistic statement at hand! The whole 'extended' sequence involving Sandler and Rogen's characters visiting the former's ex (Leslie Mann)\/ staying in Marin County is what MAKES this film! A more-than-2-hour film is ONLY a 'bad idea' if it's a BAD or mediocre film. If you've only seen it once and weren't satisfied, do yourself a favor and see it at least a couple more times.

Apatow for all his praise of his last two directorial efforts, is basically a formula director. His formula is basically alot of penis, masturbation, and oral sex jokes masking the promotion of conservative morals & family values (No sex before marriage with 40 Year Old Virgin & the responsibility of fatherhood in Knocked Up). That might sound bad but his first two films were effective comedies. Not so much with this one.The first hour of this movie is actually pretty great. It establishes the two main characters well, Seth Rogen's trying to find a way through the door comedian Ira, and Sandler's character of George Simmons which is mostly meant to mock his real life success as a movie star. Rogen is essentially playing the same character he has played in most of his starring comedic roles up to this date (minus Observe and Report) so its mostly Sandler's show in this one. They do a great job at lampooning his career with him but also let him be an interesting character in his own right with the look into his hollow existence and self realization of it. Its quite entertaining as they develop a working relationship and go on the stand up circuit.The Movie kind of falls apart after the first hour after a plot device from that hour is dropped and so the film goes off a completely different tangent. Now Sandler's character is contacts with his ex-fiance who is married and has children, and Sandler is now focused on reconnecting with her and the rest of the film revolves around that pursuit and the whole stand up comedy part is dead in the water, and alot of the minor characters from earlier in the film are for the part written out of the flick (given a few minutes of screen time at the end to wrap things up, like a small budding romance Rogen has with a comedienne and his funny yet adversarial roommates.)I dont know why Apatow did this, maybe he fealt vain and show off his wife and children again like he did in Knocked Up (even worse here as he even brings in a home video of his daughter at a talent show and gives them a ton more face time here) or whatever, but for for the rest of the movie we have another one of formulaic tricks, the conservative family values part. So you basically you know how this little endeavor ends. Another problem is that this is way way way too long. This movie shouldn't have had to be 2 hours long let alone its 2 and a half hours running time. Its just too much.With a brilliant first half hour ruined by the next hour and half this movie was disappointing. It exposes Apatow for the mediocre talent that he is, that he isnt nearly as good of a director or writer as he is as a producer. Its good when he hands over the reins to better talents like Jody Hill and David Gordon Green because he can't seem to handle all the processes at once.

The first half involves a famous Adam Sandler-like stand-up comic (played by Adam Sandler, showing almost no distance whatsoever from his usual persona) who discovers he's ill with a variant of leukemia, and who starts mentoring a young nebbishy comic (inevitably played by Seth Rogen) as he also seeks to make amends for his horrible behavior throughout his life, his lack of connections with his family, and (in particular) chasing away the great love of his life (Leslie Mann). Then the Sandler character unexpectedly responds to his treatment, and the rest of the film is mostly a (lengthy) shaggy-dog story of a weekend trip he and the Rogen character take to the San Francisco Bay Area to perform a comedy gig so he can hook up again with the married lost sweetheart.You keep waiting for the point of the movie to be revealed, and it's not until the end that you begin to see how you're supposed to make sense of the characters. By this point the patterns we see them in are so familiar from Apatow's other films that we can almost color in everything ourselves. A man has to grow up and stand on his own two feet; selfish people will eventually become lonely; a man's best friends are his freakish loser roommates... all this will seem dully familiar. Mann does not embarrass herself as Sandler's lost love; and the two charming daughters she and Apatow share, Maude and Iris, steal much of the movie as her character's daughters. Rogen does everything we've seen him do before by being shambling and lovable, and Eric Bana seems in the wrong film as Mann's studly Aussie husband. The \"Laugh, clown, laugh\" first section of the film would be truly intolerable if not for the brief comic bits with Schwartzman and (again inevitably) Jonah Hill as the loser roommates, and for the absorbing decorating details of the Sandler character's fabulous oceanside palazzo.","review\/time":"1259280000","review\/userId":"A106016KSI0Y","tipo":"negativo"},

Go back to his roots and realize the world has passed him by. Sure, he gets the ladies, a large house, and a ton of money\/great stuff, but he lost his love to his selfishness, and he has no real friends. Enter Seth Rogen, a struggling comedian who's simply not funny, and happens to be in the right place at the right time to be Simmons's right hand man\/joke writer. That's only the first half hour, and trust me, it only gets more tedious and unwelcome after that.It's always a bad idea to set an expectation in a movie title, and 'Funny People' burns in this regard. There's a lot of comedy, but there's very little funny. In fact, when Eminem & Ray Romano provide what is probably the film's funniest moment (James Taylor comes a close second), you have a serious problem. I tend to surround myself with a lot of stand-up comedy, and in studying the comics of today I get a general idea of what works and what doesn't. Guess what, Funny People's comedy doesn't work. Whether it's cameos, Jonah Hill, Adam Sandler, or Seth Rogen, they all come off very awkward and not funny, at all. Another very awkward\/uncalled for scene is the one you may have seen in the ads with Sandler brutally roasting a European guy. As someone who also makes some pretty racy jokes, even I found this scene squeamishly uncomfortable.At one point, Sandler chides Rogen's character for using too many d**k jokes because it guarantees chicks won't sleep with you. Apatow should have taken this advice because 95% of the jokes in this movie are about the d**k, and when he's going for this striking personal drama about Sandler stricken with cancer, all emotion is lost with these jokes. It's just uncalled for, and sort of kills the momentum & the movie. No I'm not prudish, I just don't think it works in this context.This brings us to the drama\/story. I learned two things from this movie. Everybody in Hollywood is a large a-hole because they let the fame go to their head, or you'll become an a-hole because you want the fame. Make no mistake about it, at some point in this film every character is an a-hole. This not only turns you off from liking the characters, but I found myself cringing or shaking my head several times in this movie because they're just so dumb, or such a-holes. Again, it's awkward. Sandler's character alone starts off an a-hole, gets better, becomes a large a-hole, then comes back down again.Casting is a rather mixed bag. Adam Sandler gives his 2nd best performance (his scene as an old man in 'Click' still wins me over), and the role is almost perfect for him. Sandler's done a lot of stupid movies like the character, and he knows comedy, drama, and being an a-hole. Rogen on the other hand was awful in his stand-up persona, then balanced throughout the film between being a jerk and being the voice of reason for George. In the end, Rogen couldn't win me over to like his character. I personally thought Leslie Mann's best scene was when Sandler went down on her. Besides that, it's always a mistake for the director to cast his wife, and by the time the character shows up in the movie it had already worn out it's welcome, and she helps run it into the ground. Jason Schwartzman also gives a good performance as a jerk, and Jonah Hill is just underused. Eric Bana? Could've done without him.After leaving the theater, I was deeply depressed & conflicted over the movie, then as soon as I looked at my iPod my mind sprang to John Mayer's \"In Repair.\" Listening to this song was really the missing piece for me since it describes George Simmons. He's in repair at the end of the film, he's not together but he's getting there. It certainly works better than a b-side John Lennon track. Still, with the exception of a few moments in the film & the last five minutes, I found little I liked about the film & it still left me rather depressed.If anything 'Funny People' is proof for me that Judd Apatow is purely lightning in a bottle. It worked in '40-year old virgin,' and to a lesser extent 'Knocked Up,' but aside from these, and displayed prominently in this movie Apatow's is a good producer, a hit & miss writer, and an atrocious director. It's painfully obvious Apatow fully expected the drama and comedy elements to mesh together, but they never did thanks in part to a barage of d**k jokes and as a result I was wanting to leave the theater over 40 minutes before the film ended. 'Funny People' is just too moody\/messy to recommend.","review\/time":"1250640000","review\/userId":"A2KW2KWKABNY","tipo":"negativo"},

He has an extremely distinct style that he manages to stamp on every one of his films. What makes him such a unique director is his ability to somehow weave together sincere and heartfelt storytelling with a seemingly perfect amount of obscene, gross-out, and often hilarious humor throughout. With Funny People, the first hour and a half is vintage Apatow--witty, crude and hilarious. The second half is where the film takes a complete nosedive. The laughs are scarce, and when they come up, they're enough for a chuckle at best.The film follows George Simmons (Adam Sandler), a stand up comedian since his high school days, who has just been diagnosed with a life threatening disease. We are given glimpses into his past that shows how he turned his success in stand-up into a career of \"sell-out\" big-budget movies that have made him millions. He begins to reflect on his life and quickly realizes that his self-absorption has left him with a mansion full of things he never uses, no real friends, just a circle of actors whom he sees every now and then, and the love of his life, Laura (Leslie Mann) married to another man.With little time left, he reaches out to the people he's lost touch with through the years and goes back to doing the thing he loves most; stand up comedy. Along the way, he meets his first true friend in Ira (Seth Rogen), an up and coming comedian whom he hires to be his personal assistant and write jokes for his routine. The film stresses how truly important it is to have close-friends in your life. If you don't have someone you can truly open up to and talk with, then all the money, expensive cars and fame won't add to anythingGeorge's life is about to end and he doesn't have a friend talk to about it.There's the potential for a great film here, but Apatow couldn't quite put it together. It feels like you're watching two different movies. The first half is hilarious, raunchy, and has just the right mix of drama. The latter half is awkward drawn out and feels completely out of place. As a whole, Funny People is a mess.-Jeffrey Ryan[...].","review\/time":"1259539200","review\/userId":"AABGV02YMQ2O","tipo":"negativo"},

And then I found myself rooting for an ending. . .any ending. Just end movie, end. Yet FUNNY PEOPLE mercilessly droned on for another half hour, culminating in predictable endings for the story's alleged love triangle and friendship between the two central male characters (Adam Sandler and Seth Rogan). Which begs the question: If everyone watching knows what's going to happen, why not wrap this puppy up and be done with it?Granted, Apatow is attempting a darker story than his zany earlier offerings. Sandler plays a comedic superstar who learns he's ailing from a deadly blood disease; accordingly Sandler deadpans this role, which only makes him completely and irretrievably unlikable. Rogan as the nobody friend of Sandler actually has some funny moments as he develops his standup routine over the course of the film, yet unfortunately there are too few of them to salvage a movie that meanders and sloshes its way to a yawnfest ending. Eric Bana is actually refreshing playing the hubby of Sandler's former love interest (Leslie Mann, anyone?), yet he arrives too late for his energy to create any positive effect. The ensemble cast (including Jonah Hill, Aubrey Plaza, and Jason Schwartzman) even looks tired and bored as FUNNY PEOPLE enters its second hour--quite the contrast from Apatow'sThe 40-Year-Old Virgin, a comedy Apatow has yet to successfully replicate.--D.

The killer tomatoes are back, and this time they have been transformed into vicious tomato-men in another vile attempt at world domination! It is up to a new group of heroes to stop Professor Gangreen before the streets run red. John De Bello and company return with their first goofy follow-up to the campy cult-classic, bringing back more of the same inane humor and kooky characters from the original along with some silly new gags. John Astin and Steve Lundquist join the cast as the crazed professor and his hunky assistant Igor in a pair of hilariously off-beat performances that account for much of the film's success. While the bad puns and ridiculous visuals often encase the film in B-movie cheese, RETURN OF THE KILLER TOMATOES shows flashes of brilliance in the tomato-smuggling scenes and the conspicuous product placement that is used to keep the film afloat. De Bello even pokes fun at the movies, themselves, as he breaks the fourth wall to reveal the cheapness of the production on several occasions.

Product placement, TV news, big breasted babes in bikinis, Michael Jackson, Miami Vice, the Pope, scams, peanut butter on pizza and many other fads of the 80's. Starring such greats as George Clooney, John Astin and, of course, Karen Mistal (who has the best bottom of any B-movie actress I have ever seen) this is NOT as funny as the first but still has a ton of laughs within its many scenes.But under all the humor is a serious view about how people felt about the last, closing years of the Cold War against Communism. In a time when the Red Menace was seen as giant ants or aliens from space the director was brave enough to show that not all Communists, who were represented by the tomatoes, were bad. Chad, the always confused main male character, falls in love with Tara, a tomato-woman(but then who won't fall in love with a smart, willing, good cooking, great dressing tomato?). And FT, played by FT,(who as we all know become a huge star in the film industry as while as live theater in Europe), starred as the socialist with a heart of gold, who was even willing to put his own life in danger for the American way of life.

The rating says it all, PAY ATTENTION.The second thing you must realize is that this is an ADAM SANDLER movie, like his earlier films. Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, all crude and rude, get over it. That was his style and he brought it back to make one of the funniest adult animated movies ever. The jokes here are classic, from whiteys seizures to him doing the robot in the middle of a basketball game. His sister eleanor has the cutest voice which I've been imitating ever since I saw the movie. The townsfolk are a scream, with rob schneider as an asian waiter. and jon lovitz as a man with a hook for a hand. This is a very unconventional Hannukah movie for the holidays. Sure it's gross, but if your offended than go rent the Ya Ya Sisterhood or some crap like that.This one is for the guys, not for parents or children. Next time read the rating before you complain.

Unlike The Wedding Singer, the humor was a bit more locker room gross-out, but like the Wedding Singer, it was filled with sentiment and heart. An angry Scrooge-like Jewish man learns to grieve, let go, and love the holidays again. No, it's not for small kids. That's why it's rated PG-13. Sandler shows tremendous talent and versatility as the voices of Davy, Eleanor and Whitey, the latter two being annoying elderly fraternal twins whom Davy grows to love despite their freakishness. Rob Schneider, Jon Lovitz, Kevin Nieland add their talent, as well as cameos by Tyra Banks and rock singer Ann Wilson as Davy's mom. Alison Krauss lends her sweetness as the singing voice of Jennifer, Davy's childhood love, now a single mom. The music is the most outstanding part of this film. The lyrics are silly and goofy, but also clever, and the song structures are dynamic and hooky, and will stay with you afterward. If you go into this movie realizing it's not a white-washed Disney flick for the kids, but it's a funny, sometimes gross, but sensitive Christmas story that tackles somewhat-adult issues, like why some people hate the holidays, I think you'll enjoy it almost as much as I did. It's also loaded with special features that are worthwhile, too.","review\/time":"1069286400","review\/userId":"A3L753EAJUYW","tipo":"positivo"},

I have two things to say to that: (1)not only is the film rated PG-13, but in today's age of ultra-descriptive ratings explanations courtesy of the MPAA, they even let you know in the rating description that this movie contains crude humor. And (2) this is Adam Sandler, people. It's not Jimmy Stewart or Tom Hanks. It's a comedian\/actor who's built his career on crude humor, so if you mis-gauged what the tone of this flick would be, it's your own fault. I thought it was great. I think it was purposely made to appear like a family movie but actually be crude, just to be ironic and clever.I'm surprised people are so quick to say all that's wrong with this movie, yet no one seems to give kudos to Sandler for making a holiday movie that's focused on Hanukkah, an often overlooked holiday in the mainstream entertainment industry. I'm not saying this movie has some deep, revelatory moral center that pays homage to the Jewish faith, I'm just citing it as another example of the refreshing way Sandler crafted an entertainingly irreverent holiday spoof flick.Take movies for what they are. If you don't like them, fine - we're all entitled to our own opinions. But to criticize a film for not measuring up to the misjudged idea of what you thought it would be is just plain silly.

Were the ghost of Lewis to drop in for a holiday screening of this film, however, I think he'd say, \"It's a good film, Adam, but it could have been great.\" How could it have been great? With a little restraint, instead of playing for the South Park\/ Family Guy crowd, this could have been a family film. We desperately need a funny holiday special, not more schmaltzy ones, and this could have been it. Adam Sandler knows it too. He very much caught the spirit of Mr. Deeds. He shone in Big Daddy. He brilliantly calls his production company Happy Madison, saying heck if you didn't like Billy Madison (I did by the way), and refusing to be typecast as Happy Gilmore.It also took guts to \"play\" Davy, not just voice him, as with the usual animation voiceovers. Davy is conflicted and Adam plays him that way. There are hints and tributes to \"It's a Wonderful Life,\" but there are also echoes of a Jerry Lewis film called \"The Delinquent\". This is a PG-13 film merely for the reason that Adam had the bad luck of working when films and TV lack the restraint and limits that Lewis and earlier comedians worked within and which make for great art.So thanks to that rating, kids won't get to see Davy struggle with tough breaks and big questions. Nor will they see the opening scene of a Chanukah menorah and nativity scene coexisting side by side. They won't even get to hear the third version of Sandler's witty \"Chanukah Song\". What they'll get instead is more innocuous clones of someone saving Christmas by rescuing Santa Clause from the Martians or whoever his captors are this year.That leaves us with only A Christmas Story. Jean Shepherd, who writes his books for adults, restrained himself to make this movie family- friendly and came up with a holiday classic. Paul Reubens breathed new life into Saturday Morning by making Pee Wee's Playhouse into a kids' show. And when Davy-- I mean Adam-- decides to use his talents for kids, he'll be another Jerry Lewis.","review\/time":"1166745600","review\/userId":"A3QAQUUPFIAR","tipo":"positivo"},

This now grown man, Davey Stone (voice - Adam Sandler), is constantly getting into trouble and doesn't really seem to care.As the town's Christmas celebrations get underway, Davey creates a ruckus running from the police and lands himself in court, where he is about to receive a strict punishment, only for the local town do-gooder, Whitey (voice - Adam Sandler), to step in and volunteer to reform Davey by making him help referee the youth basketball games (where he used to be the star). The judge agrees and Davey is now forced to spend his time refereeing. Whitey also does his best to befriend Davey, but only really gets the chance when Davey makes a fool out of some guys at the local gym who retaliate by burning down his trailer.Davey is then invited to and decides to move in with Whitey and his spinster sister, Eleanore (voice - Adam Sandler). Slowly, Eleanore and Whitey work their way into Davey's life, only to burn their inroads when Whitey innocently relates the story of what happened to Davey's parents. As Davey's inability to deal with this part of his past is the cause of his misbehavior, Whitey's recounting of the story turns him back into the anti-social jerk and leads him to rudely criticize Whitey.Doing his best to brush off the criticism, Whitey then heads for home to get ready for the town's annual Christmas banquet. Whitey, as the town do-gooder, has been trying for years to win the town's prestigious ribbon given for outstanding service to the basketball league. Whitey and Eleanore dress in their finest, fully believing that this year will be Whitey's triumph. When he doesn't win, Davey's haunting criticisms come back and Whitey finally realizes that the townspeople really don't seem to care about him and all of the things he does for them. Crushed, he leaves with Eleanor to find solace in the mall. But Davey, having experienced a change of heart (also in the mall; Adam Sandler must have some strange mall fixation), bursts into the town celebration and gives them a powerful lecture on how they have overlooked Whitey, who has only been nice to everyone his entire life. The townspeople finally come to their senses and realize their mistake. They race to the mall and bestow upon Whitey the ribbons he truly deserves (he gets them from all the years he should have won them, which are all of them), resulting in a rather touching climax where Whitey's years of service are finally recognized.My Comments:I almost hate to admit it, but I was actually touched by this movie. It did such a good job of making Whitey a lovable but pathetic character who only experiences frustrating defeats that you can only feel sorry for him. In my more humanitarian moments (like right now as I write this), I am inclined to see Whitey as a representation of the average man (though heavily laden with pitiable characteristics) and this movie as being about how those people who do so much for society are often overlooked. This is especially true considering the person who wins the ribbon during the celebration is a billionaire who shelled out a pittance (for him) to buy a new scoreboard, as compared to Whitey's immeasurable time contributions (basically a variation of the Widow's mite story from the New Testament).But the movie isn't without its problems. The biggest one is really something my wife pointed out early on: Who is the movie targeting? I mean, it seems most movies have an intended audience and\/or a specific genre (action, drama, young girls, etc.), but this one doesn't really seem to have either. Because it's a cartoon you might think young kids. But this is really a cross between the Simpsons and South Park in crudeness, which means you can rule out children under 10. Teenagers may find it too cheesy to bear, and adults likely won't find it initially engaging, meaning you've lost all of your potential audiences. However, if you can make it through the first 30 minutes or so until you really get to know Whitey and fall in love with his character, the movie may suck you in, but you really do have to give it a lot of leeway.As far as the story goes, it's not perfect and I don't think it has any pretenses to be perfect. Where is Davey's extended family? What happens between him and his former girlfriend? Why is Davey such a jerk? Even without answering these questions, the story works, but it does take a while to get your attention.Overall, I didn't have very high expectations going into this movie and I really wasn't sure what to expect as it seemed to be some sort of hybrid Hanukah\/Christmas movie. I didn't end up loving the movie, but it was better than I thought it was going to be and I was actually touched by the story, though I was touched more by Whitey than by Davey. It definitely isn't a movie for young kids, but some adolescents may enjoy and young adults may as well. It's probably a bit too crass for older adults to appreciate it, but you might be surprised.","review\/time":"1070236800","review\/userId":"AO3JW5VHT2GQ","tipo":"neutral"},

Are they cinematic treasures? Heck no! They're nothing more than fun comedies that make me laugh. And with that in mind, I expected nothing less from this movie, even if it is the animated adventures of a Sandler character.What I got instead was a mish mash of several movie styles that never quite gels. Sure, it made me feel good by films end but I think that has more to do with my feelings towards sappy movies during the holidays than the movie itself (see review of ELF).The story revolves around Davey (Sandler) who is the town jerk. Having had the chance to make something of his life, he tossed it all aside one fateful night when his parents died on the way to watch him play in a junior league basketball game. Now the town drunk, a run in with the law is about to land him in jail. Until a kindly, tiny voice speaks up.Whitey (again Sandler) is the town do-gooder. He has worked forever at the town recreation center with kids playing there since the days when Davey was learning his first jump shot. Whitey sees something in Davey that no one else does and takes a chance on him. He has him turned over to his custody and has him help at the center.But years of bitterness have left Davey hollow inside. He has no use for anyone. He treats everyone with disdain. He even goes so far as to admit that he hates himself. It isn't until he meets Jennifer, the girl of his dreams long ago, again and her son that he begins to even consider coming around.But as fate would have it, things continue to go from bad to worse until Davey makes the decision to leave town behind and make a run for it. On the night when Whitey hopes to earn the towns respect for the years he has given by receiving an award called the spirit patch, Davey hits the road knowing full well that it won't happen. While Whitey may give more to the town than the people realize, he is one of those faceless people that does it all and receives no praise. And if Davey leaves, it becomes just one more major disappointment in Whitey's life.Unless a Christmas miracle could take place.Now, while the plot of this movie seems quite simple that's because...well...it is. Surrounding the story of Davey and Whitey are the small tales of the rest of the townsfolk. The adventures and predicaments that the pair gets involved in as well as musical numbers fill it out as well. And what would a Sandler film be without tons of crude humor? If toilet humor (and in some cases here I mean that literally) offends or disgust you then this movie is not your cup of tea.While I enjoyed the comedy here as well as the animation and story beneath it all, I found that there was too much mean spirit running throughout for me to embrace it. The joy of the film does not come about until the final moments of the film, long after we have been bombarded with the cruelty over and over again. The ending does raise that warm fuzzy feeling inside but at what cost to get there?This is one movie that will have a hard time finding an audience. Most people over 12 aren't that interested in animated films. And those over 30 will not find the gross out humor all that great. But there are a few of us twisted people out there who will enjoy this one even if not making it a regular Christmas treat. Watching it once may be enough. But it is definitely for selective tastes.","review\/time":"1205366400","review\/userId":"A2DAHERP7HYJ","tipo":"positivo"},

Rausch \"myspace.com\/rauschofficial\"","review\/score":"2.0","review\/summary":"Nobody's Perfect","review\/text":"Everyone's allowed to flop now and then. No matter how surprisingly. I'm pretty big on Adam Sandler. He was integral in championing the glory days of SNL. His humor is sick, perverted, and offensive - to some people, that is. Me, I find myself laughing myself half to death at the most shallow of toilet humor when engineered by Sandler, whereas 99% of society looks stupid and superfluous when the execution of this type of humor gets into the wrong hands. If you think NOBODY can pull off a fart joke that's actually funny, make sure you check out his first two cd's before nailing the coffin. They get old, but thankfully it takes a while for that to happen.Then came his movies. One after another, legions of Sandler followers attended a decade's worth of 90 minute comedies which were diverse in storylines but similar in format and style. Fans couldn't have cared less about most critics' \"2.5\/4 ish ratings.\" Adam Sandler was and is a big pioneer of the kind of random humor that made big shots like Conan O'brien famous. Many don't get it, so they dismiss the Adam Sandler catalog entirely, though not before using some of the adjectives I demonstrated in the opening paragraph.But then came this movie. I missed it in the theaters, so I rented it instead of buying it - smart move on all accounts. The first time I heard Whitey in the courtroom, I thought it was Adam's (\"Stone\"'s) main character just changing his tone of voice amidst his rantings with the judge. In due time, my brain recovered and realized that Adam was actually voicing an entirely different character. This is a huge joke - and not the kind that Sandler was going for. I've heard much better, and more contrasting, and much FUNNIER voices on his cd's, and basically anywhere else outside this project. Huge mistake #1 is having your two main characters have almost the same voice. It's as if the one character is just speaking in a higher voice the whole time, and it's not convincing at all. In other words, that's one strike for poor acting.Huge mistake #2 is the plot. Whenever you've got animators involved, it pains me to see a great technical effort wasted on a failed delivery of entertainment. A promising youth gone bad after tragedy strikes - that's what briefly takes the main character on the tried-and-tired-to-death path of needing to confront his emotions.What audience is this geared towards? It has the aspirations of a child's movie, which would make it more forgivable, but that notion is quickly dissolved as soon as we start seeing the stereotypical Sandlerisms that always randomly invade his work. Ok, not for children. But the 3rd grade plot makes a viewer who is any older than that want to beg for 74 minutes of his life back...The movie's so short, barely over an hour, but 15 minutes into it I felt like time was moving so slowly, I was back in highschool. That NEVER happens with the always creative Adam Sandler, as he always keeps you involved... well, now we've got to change that to ALMOST always. I hate to say it, but Adam made a boring movie. What a time to have writer's block.","review\/time":"1076803200","review\/userId":"A2QYE48KP1U5","tipo":"negativo"},

Please don't even rent!","review\/text":"This is the first movie I've ever even thought about writing a review for in here. My hope is that people don't waste their money, or reward Sandler and the studio for this garbage. This movie has replaced \"Caddyshack 2\" and \"Weekend at Bernie's 2\" at the bottom of my worst-movie scrap heap. It was pure torture. I watched all the way to the end just to see if there was some redeeming joke or scene that would at least salvage an intelligent laugh. No luck. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big Adam Sandler fan. I even found Little Nicky somewhat humerous. My favorite Sandler movie was Happy Gilmore, and I loved his career on Saturday Night Live. But where this abomination came from, I have no idea. Just the annoying voice of \"Whitey\", one of the main characters, is enough to give you a headache. I think this movie is the result of a bet with his buddies that he could make X amount of dollars off of it just because of his name being affiliated with it. I can almost guarantee you will be very sorry if you actually purchase it. If you don't believe me, at the very least rent it first and save yourself the buyers remorse. The people that give this movie a 5 star review HAVE to be Amazon stockholders or buddies of Sandlers. It's that bad. Don't want to take my word for it?

He can do anything he wants and I'm glad that he made an attempt at making an animated movie. Perhaps he shouldn't have even tried because EIGHT CRAZY NIGHTS is just plain terrible. Other than a couple of scenes and a soundtrack that's better than the movie itself, this movie is horrible. I mean, the Farrelly Brothers would be hard pressed to come up with something as sick and warped as this film. There's a guy who eats his jock strap, talking deer who eat feces, a woman with three breasts, and a poor old man whose one foot is smaller than the other and is covered in white hair. Each one of these creatures receive no sympathy (well the old guy does in the end) and instead are used totally as the butt of jokes. Davy Jones' conversion at the end of the film is totally unrealistic and in some ways even inappropriate. This is a film only for die-hard Sandler fans and that's about all, however I am giving this movie 2 stars instead of 1 because of the kicking soundtrack.","review\/time":"1075420800","review\/userId":"A96K1ZGW56S2","tipo":"negativo"},

Zwick","review\/score":"3.0","review\/summary":"a mixed bag but some of it is fun","review\/text":"\"Eight Crazy Nights\" is like an animated holiday special as it might be envisioned and conceived by the Farrelly Brothers - rude, crude, vulgar, yet surprisingly conformist in its values and themes.The people actually responsible for the film are director Seth Kearsley, and writers Brooks Arthur, Allen Covert, Brad Isaacs and Adam Sandler. Sandler also provides the voice for the lead character, Davey Stone, a 30-something curmudgeon who hates the holidays and goes out of his way to ruin them for everyone else. As a public menace, Davey finds himself assigned by court order to assist a sweet, but addled septuagenarian who coaches a youth basketball team.Part of the fun of \"Eight Crazy Nights\" comes from the strange dichotomy between the film's crude humor and the picture postcard small town setting. This film looks like every Christmas special ever made, yet when the characters open their mouths...well, all I can say is that \"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\" or \"Frosty the Snowman\" this ain't. Some people may be offended by the antics contained in this film, and it is certainly not recommended viewing for very small children. But the film is really no worse in tone than the average Sandler comedy and the humor is nothing that every prepubescent boy hasn't heard or even indulged in himself (though the scatological sequences involving some deer are a bit much). In fact, one of the criticisms that can be leveled against the film is that it really isn't raunchy enough, that it wants to have it both ways. It wants to come across as a daring and iconoclastic image-buster, yet it can't resist employing the very same heart tugs that virtually all other holiday films employ and which this film is supposed to be a reaction against. Unlike, say, \"South Park,\" which makes no concessions to sentimentality, \"Eight Crazy Nights\" loses its nerve and becomes just another warm-hearted and cuddly holiday-themed film at the end. That's too bad because we really could use a corrosive tonic long about this time of the year. After all who decreed that all holiday films had to be pure sweetness and light? Isn't running over grandma with a reindeer also a holiday tradition?Still, \"Eight Crazy Nights\" does have some very shrewd, very clever, very funny moments contained within it, enough to almost compensate for the conventional gooey ending - and it does a nice job parodying the musical interludes generally found in more conventional Disney-type animated features as well. Moreover, \"Eight Crazy Nights\" has historical significance in that it is the first movie I can remember in which Chanukah achieves equal billing with Christmas. That's a long overdue correction, I must say, although I'm just not sure that Jewish mothers quite had this in mind when they envisioned it finally happening.

I'm *not* anti-Sandler. But this movie just left me in shock at how purely bad it was. What bothered me most, I think, was the cruelty shown here toward other people, at other peoples' expense. Be warned: This is NOT a children's movie! And again, I can enjoy Sandler's off-beat humor. This movie is just a waste of time and ranks among my all-time worst movie experiences ever. In addition to that, it contains the most blatant advertising used in a movie that I have ever seen. The two main characters walk into a huge mall and the one character simply starts pointing out all the fine stores in the mall, one after the other after the other after the other after the other.

Unfortunately, it ain't too great...","review\/text":"\"Adam Sandler's Eight Crazy Nights\" could have been a really sweet Christmas story with a heartwarming message at its core. Instead, it's a vile, heartless animated feature that swerves back and forth between naughty and nice, not sure what to become. Take, for instance, the scene towards the end, when the mayor of Dukesbury (voiced by Kevin Nealon) cracks a very unfunny joke in the town hall, and the citizens of Dukesbury start to snort snot all over their tables, and some deer outside get in such a violent fit of laughter that feces squirts from behind their tails with little *splurt* sounds.Does that sound like a good-natured family comedy to you? That's because it isn't. The film stars, in one way or another, Adam Sandler, who has finally found a suitable medium to let loose all his crudeness without (a) getting the film banned from every country in the world, and (b) injuring himself in the process. Because there's something innocent about cartoons. In \"Eight Crazy Nights,\" his self-crafted character, Davey Stone, is on the run from the town police after ripping off a Chinese man (voiced by Rob Schneider). He picks up the lid of a trashcan and slides down a railing like Vin Diesel did in \"xXx.\" It's funny to see a limitless and physically fit Sandler, yes, but right as the scene starts to become fun, we get a worn out gag involving squeezed melons that has been done countless times before, including last year's \"Austin Powers in Goldmember.\"Davey resents the holidays, and he especially resents the \"eight crazy nights\" of Hanukkah, because when he was 12 years old his parents died on their way to his basketball game. Ever since, Davey has been the town troublemaker, getting stoned (hence his last name?) and making out with cars. (Don't ask.)Davey gets picked up by the cops and is sentenced to ten years in jail, when the town eccentric, Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), offers the judge to make Davey a basketball referee in hopes of changing his ill spirits. The judge agrees, but as soon as Davey leaves court he throws Whitey into a porta-potty and knocks it down a hill. Whitey emerges with human feces all over his body, and Davey then sprays him with water, saying, \"See ya' later, poopsicle.\"That's why the film careens from gross-out gags to heartwarming moments and then back to juvenile bodily function jokes. You've probably heard a lot of people complain about bodily function humor and how bad it is, but this will disgust the most crude and vile audience members. I did for me. (Hey, I'm joking! About being crude. Er...never mind.)A lot of people hate Adam Sandler and his humor, but I think they're just all jumping on the bandwagon. Ironically, his \"breakthrough role\" in P.T. Anderon's 2002 art film \"Punch-Drunk Love\" has been praised as his crowning triumph. I, personally, still enjoy \"Happy Gilmore\" and \"Big Daddy.\" His comedies are very basic but also, on occasion, very funny. I also like \"Saturday Night Live\"-type humor a lot, so that may have something to do with it.Is \"Eight Crazy Nights\" a bad movie? I guess. It's hard to place a finger on. It's mean-spirited and vile, and that's where the film fails, but when the film has its touching moments they are touching. Too bad it always has to ruin the mentioned scenes by ending them with lame poop and\/or seizure jokes. Again, don't ask.","review\/time":"1071014400","review\/userId":"A2TDK8D4HEMU","tipo":"neutral"},

I've seen most of his movies(Big Daddy,Mr.Deeds,The Waterboy,)and now Eight Crazy Nights which I have been looking forward to for a little while. The movie is not just laughs but also has a heartwarming style apart from it's constant crude humor. Adam Sandler doesn't just play one voice in the film but three. Also doing voices are Jon Lovitz,and Tara Banks. The bad part of the movie is that it is a little too short. They moved from when the main character was bad and then the next scene he's good. They could have shown what happened in that interval of time between his moods.The film is about Davey Stone(Adam Sandler) who used to be a great nice kid. Davey isn't the greatest person and gets drunk often and is overall not a nice person. His life changes when he rips up a bill in a resturant and rips the guy off. He gets sent to court and is about to be sentenced when Whitey Durvall(Adam Sandler)tells the judge that he could be a ref in training for the youth basketball leaque and Whitey's partner. The movie spans through the eight days of Hankukaa and also how Davey has to change his life with the help of Whitey. Whitey's story is how he is trying to win a patch for the person in the town who has contributed the most. The patch has been running for 35 years and Whitey has not won once.The movie has tons of crude and sexual jokes. In fact every single joke is crude but the movie is still funny and gets my recomendation.ENJOY!","review\/time":"1038528000","review\/userId":"A1R2URG8OHNE","tipo":"positivo"},

Bridell \"Lost Johnny\"","review\/score":"1.0","review\/summary":"A Christmas Memory I'd rather forget.","review\/text":"First off I do not dislike Adam Sandler, I rather enjoy some of his raunchy antics on film, not so much because I like raunchy antics, but because of the underlying message. Adam Sandler really does have a good heart and his films always show this. You can scoff at his bathroom jokes and spitting, farting etc, but he does that to satisfy his fans who paid money to see him, he is loyal to his fans and to his friends. Ever notice how he always gives jobs to Rob Schneider and Dana Carvey? No one else does, that's a good friend, also his good old fashioned small town morals always win out of the rich, evil fat cats who try to squeeze him in his films. He never sinks to there level either, perhaps that is why ECN was such a creepy, deeply disturbing film, I cannot, in recent memory recall a more unpleasant time at the movies,what was he thinking? Early on in the film his character, a drunken loser, belches very loudly in a Chinese restaurant \" Ok I go take shower now\" says Chinese waiter. I wanted to take a shower too, very soon after that scene. For starters Mr. Sandler seems to think he is a voice over man, he is not. His idea of a character voice is to squeak his lines out in a nearly impossible to understand whiny nasal twang that is not unlike running a nail down a chalkboard. One can barely understand he is trying to do a character, and he barely is. Also he is the voice of at least four of his characters, he is equally bad in each. Perhaps the most confusing and depressing is the old white heard man who lives with his sister in a little old house, he wants desperately to win a patch saying he is the town good guy or something, he coaches the kids basketball team, he has been for years, and apparently does not work except to do crappy jobs for no pay so people can ignore and not appreciate him, he is simply there to be lovable, and put upon, he is slightly less subtle then a pie in the face (as is the so-called humor here). The script calls for Sandlers character to be a total jerk for no other reason other then to be redeemed at the end, there is no real motivation for his bazaar, cruel and badly aimed antics other then the screenplay calls for them. He starts off the film by driving a snowmobile drunk and smashing two ice sculptures, a menorah and a Christmas thing, I forget what it was. He is a repeat offender so his sentence will be a harsh one, but along comes old squeaky voice to offer the judge a chance to give him a reduced sentence, he lets him coach basketball with him in lue of time in the clink, I can just see the road runner and bugs bunny rolling there eyes and shaking there heads, surly, even in a cartoon there is some sort of rule book. Not here. Of course the judge remands him to the custody of squeaky and off they go. The film then goes on to showcase some of the most outrageous, mindnumbing scenes of animated mayhem this side of a Japanese manga involving tentacles and girls in school uniforms. He goes to the basketball game and insults the children, ridiculing one boy for being fat, the coach is knocked unconscious and puts his hand in his pants \"nice kitty kitty\" he squeaks, what the???? then an angry father gets on Sandlers bad side (his only side) and is force fed a jock strap \"I hope you like them extra sweaty\" Ho Ho Ho. For the next part of the film which seems like eight days, crazy or otherwise, his house is burned, he pushes his benefactor down a hill, in a porta potty which freezes feces on him, he is rescued by deer who lick the poop off him, on smiles with a load of ca ca in his teeth. We are treated to this twice. God bless us, every one. By the time the paint by number ending finally gets there we are also subjected to a number of songs, each worse then the last, fortunately they are forgettable as well as bad \"If I move my bowls without using the spray....that's a technical foul\" is one of few lines I remember, thank you God. By reading this one might assume, as I did, that this is irreverent in the good way, poking fun at old Christmas standards, but it is not. It is disgusting, badly written, annoying and very, very cruel. The two dimensional nice old brother and sister are treated horribly, for no good reason with no motivation or payoff, the songs are unlistnable and the dialogue is hard to understand, this is not always a bad thing. Of course we discover why the hero is such a jerk, a childhood trauma involving a car crash on Hanukkah, he hooks up with is old sweetheart and lives happily ever after. The same cannot be said for the audience. Why would anyone think this was funny or appropriate, who is the audience? There are many vulgar sexual references that are not claver or cutting edge they are sad and out of place, the over all feel of the film is one of depressed Sinicism and a morbid sense of doom and hopelessness. Adam Sandler has been loyal to his friends, his friends should have been loyal to him and told him what a bad idea this was, even if it hurt his feelings. This Christmas turkey won't even work as leftovers. Bah Humbug.","review\/time":"1102377600","review\/userId":"AQ2RL6HTVI86","tipo":"negativo"},

Davey Stone (the voice of Adam Sandler) is a teenager that has a reputation for getting in trouble and for being misctuvis. On the 1st night of Chanukah Davey gets in trouble for drunk driving and stealing. When he goes to court the judge sentences to 5 years in jail, but Whitey, an old crazy basketball referee, insists that Davey do community service.Davey learns to appreciate the holidays and to appreciate other people. Davey turns into a semi-good person, by the end of the movie. In this movie, the characters were great although there wasn't such an original plot. The things that the characters did were unexpected, but not so creative.I did not think that this was Adam Sandler's best movie but this is up there.

I'm sorry if you expected something else from this movie and that your upset about wasting money on a movie that you apparently bought with blind faith for the humor of Adam Sandler. But to be judgemental with your main reason for doing so is comparing it is ridiculous. I personaly liked this movie. Not because it's a Adam Sandler film, not because I liked his other movies, but for the humor I found in this movie. I noticed this same thing in reviews of another movie called Chasing Amy. Done by the same director of movies such as Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks, this movie got terrible reviews of how it didnt meet the exspectations of the viewers, the viewers assuming it to be like the other movies done by this artist. Far be it for adults to actually judge a movie for waht its worth.

But it's not without its merits. If you're a fan of Sandler and his kind of humor, you will enjoy this movie. If you don't like Adam Sandler, you probably won't like this movie, period.I'm not a HUGE fan of Sandler, but I have enjoyed his movies (50 First Dates, Little Nicky, Mr. Deeds) so it was funny to see an animated version of him running around. The story isn't all slapstick and lowbrow humor, though. There's a moral to this story (you just have to look beyond the humor) which may be surprising. This movie is not without dirty humor, but I found it amusing (like the basketball scene with Sandler, the boy, the fat guy with the jockstrap, and the two guys who had been giving Sandler and the boy a hard time) and Whitey and his sister were amusing characters. Overall a funny movie and a decent addition to any Sandler collection.This is definitely NOT a movie for little kids. It's a cartoon, but this movie would go great on Adult Swim. I understand that some of the negative reviews for this film are from parents who complain about its inappropriateness for kids. YES, it's not for little kids - but the only kid-friendly Sandler movie I saw was 'Bedtime Stories', so anyone who is familiar with him should not be surprised that this movie is not for the little ones. If Amazon let me give half stars, this movie would get 3 1\/2 stars.","review\/time":"1260921600","review\/userId":"A370Z6I5GBWU","tipo":"neutral"},

I used to be an Adam Sandler fan, but when he keeps pushing out garbage like this .... I have to seriously question my previous judgement. I loved some of his previous work, but this one was just way too much for me to take. I watched this with a large group of people, and we all agreed that this film just had to go. We made it to just under 40 minutes, so we gave it a chance.I cannot stress enough as to how annoying this film got in just those 40 minutes. The voice of Whitey (Sandler) was like somebody taking a fork and raking it across a chalkboard, pure pain. The humor was few (and I mean very few) and far between. The deer licking poop from a frozen Whitey and a trouble making lead role (also Sandler) were the highlights, and they just weren't funny but were billed as some of the biggest laughs of the film? Sorry folks I just didn't see it, nobody did. I was severly disappointed.In summary, skip this one and go buy\/watch the Water Boy, Happy Gilmore, Big Daddy, or something else. Even that piece of junk Little Nicky was a ton better than this garbage.","review\/time":"1070668800","review\/userId":"A3QLZ79JF6R1","tipo":"negativo"},

I LOVED IT!","review\/text":"As you know... this is probably one of the most hated movies ever... and why is that?? Because these days, people just want to see boring, crappy romantic comedy junk like \"Love Actually\" and \"Two Weeks Notice\"..... Well I don't care about the negative reviews, I loved this movie and I'll admit that I bought it and I've watched it to the point where I know every song by heart :)I think this movie is somewhat similar to \"Bad Santa\" (another hillarious film that is worth seeing), in that it deals with a drunk no-life loser who just CANT STAND the holidays AT ALL (much like me,,, seeing & hearing Christmas stuff everywhere gets SO incredibly annoying!) This is a hillarious story of a \"crazy 33-year-old Jewish guy\" who always has to do bad things to the town during the holidays, especially on the first night of Hanukkah,, and there's a reason why he's this way,, and he just keeps seeming to run from admitting that reason...(I won't tell you what it is, dont wanna ruin it :)This movie has great voices by Sandler of course, and Rob Schnieder is great as the narrator and the Chinese waiter... Also I love all the songs, especially \"I Hate Love, I Hate You, I Hate Me\", \"Technical Foul\", and \"Let It Out, Davey\"Believe it or not this movie DOES have a good messege behind it-actually a few- one is that you shouldn't run from your emotions, and the other is that the most ignored people can do the nicest things (which goes so for Whitey, the old man who helps Davey)I would say that this & \"Bad Santa\" are 2 great movies to slap the \"happy-go-lucky\" holiday season junk in the face, and if you can't appreciate this kind of humor, then go watch some Julia Roberts movie or some teenybopper movie like \"10 Things I Hate About You\"!!!!!","review\/time":"1073174400","review\/userId":"AYOLDSNPONSE","tipo":"positivo"},

But you may very well not like it at all. Answering a couple quick questions will help you know whether you should stay away from Eight Crazy Nights:Can anything in an artwork offend you? Be honest here; there's nothing wrong with you if you can be offended by content. If you're the kind of person who might say, \"I normally don't mind (or I even like) crude humor, but that just went too far\", then the answer is \"yes\". If you think that an artwork can go too far, if you have any personal sacred cows, then be very cautious of watching Eight Crazy Nights.Next, do you like to think of yourself as being more mature than you were as, say, a 13 year old? I don't just mean, \"Are you more mature\", but do you pride yourself on that, so that you don't find joy in playing 13-year-old again. If yes, that's another indicator for caution.And finally, for people who actually are teens and who answered \"No\" to the above questions, do you dislike your crude humor to have any positive messages or sentimentality? If yes, use caution.It's not that Eight Crazy Nights is the most outrageous, risk-taking, potentially offensive comedy ever, or that it's constantly juvenile or ever over-the-top sappy. For offense and maturity, there's nothing here that's not found in the average episode of South Park. But maybe because it's an animated holiday film where many people aren't expecting something like South Park, a lot of viewers--especially the offendable and proudly sophisticated--have turned up their noses.Eight Crazy Nights is actually quite complex and sophisticated on many artistic levels. The animation is exceptionally well done--at least as good and complex as most Disney features. For example, there are many subtle layering and perspective effects, similar to Disney's multiplane approach, and often mimicking \"live action\" cameras, so that different focal depths will be blurred. The environments are lush and subtly modeled. Characters are fluid and well drawn. There are many difficult sequences, such as action and sports scenes, and they're all very impressive.Script-wise, Adam Sandler achieved a film that both mocks\/spoofs traditional holiday films and manages to be one at the same time. It's not that different in theory from, say, Elf or Bad Santa, except that Sandler isn't at all afraid to continually go for the throat in his brand of humor (which isn't to suggest that Elf or Bad Santa are bad films--I love both of them, and especially Bad Santa goes for the throat sometimes, too). The plot has some similarities to A Christmas Carol in that the main character, Davey (voiced by Sandler), has an over-the-top, bitter, bah-humbug attitude about the holidays brought on by past events. Davey is even visited by something akin to supernatural entities at one point.Sandler's music and music performances are impressive. The focus is on silly\/funny lyrics, of course, but at times, his singing and songwriting skills suggest that he could have easily had a career in the music business instead. While watching Eight Crazy Nights I kept thinking how much I'd like to see a Sandler penned Broadway show--that would be just the thing to help knock Broadway out of its frustrating musical and content conservatism.A couple characters, especially Whitey (also voiced by Sandler), take some getting used to. Sandler is doing one of his odd, affected voices for the character, and Whitey is designed to be disturbing and disagreeable. But of course the joke is that he's the symbol of positive holiday spirit, so Sandler is again pulling the rug out from beneath our expectations--something he does regularly, in many different ways, throughout the course of Eight Crazy Nights--and that's a good thing.","review\/time":"1166400000","review\/userId":"A1Q1PP3Z4QDU","tipo":"neutral"},

However, I took a chance and went to see \"Eight Crazy Nights\" on Sunday, and it was by far one of the FUNNIEST movies I've ever seen......animated or not. I swear, I laughed so hard throughout this entire movie to the point where my sides were aching!One thing that needs to be made CRYSTAL clear is the fact that this is not a kids' movie by any means. I think the trailers and commercials for \"Eight Crazy Nights\" are rather misleading in regards to this fact. I realized this when I saw at least 5 sets of parents bring their children to see it.This movie doesn't try to be the next animated marvel. It seems that many critics fail to realize that, and put the movie down because of its mere simplicity. It's a simple movie with a simple plot, intended for a teen-to-adult audience, in addition to catering to Sandler's loyal fanbase.Much like \"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut\", this movie contains profanity (not as much mind you) but it's there, as well as various sexual innuendos, and plenty of noisy bodily functions. lol.If you clear away the comedic purpose of the film, etc. There really is a touching plot to this movie. In short, a town troublemaker gets in deep with the law. With his back against the wall, a kind, old man offers him a chance of redemption and appoints him as the Jewish Youth Centre's assistant basketball coach. I won't give it all away, but the story gives true meaning of friendship and hope.I know, everyone's a critic....and I guess I'm one of them. But truth be told, this IS a great movie. It's not for everyone. If you're easily offended, may I suggest \"Santa Clause 2\". But for those of you who are willing to let go of your senses for 70 odd minutes and have a good laugh, then you really can't go wrong with this one.

Something I've come to realize after watching some of Sandler's latter works is how big his heart really is. From noticing names in the credits that I have to admire him for to just having a big heart.It isn't the best animation but given what the film took to be made it was lucky it got made. Here are points that I thought the film did a wonderful job of.1. Making its characters real, not some fantasy realm characters, but characters with defects like we all have, some of us have them more noticeable then others.2. seeing one of many ways a good kid can become less then a good kid.3. giving us something other then christmas, I was happy to see someone make a film about a Jewish Holiday and by someone that is proud to be what he is.4. for actually giving me something to show my kids, hey while many of you crab about it not being a kids film or etc. I think it works well for kids. Kids aren't stupid and they see the world for what it is and its nice to let them see the story that lies beyond view. Because we all know a guy like whitey that takes a lump but never lets it phase him, or a guy like davey that drinks his problems away, or even the single mom that is just trying to make it work. And if you talk openly with your kids and don't try and hide them from the real world then they'll ask questions and you can talk.5. Because Deer really don't care about poopsicles just humans.You don't need to be an Adam Sandler fan to love this movie. My wife was iffy but then cried, laughed, and shivered (the whole porta potty scene). She loved it and thought it was great and thanked me for chaining her to the chair to watch it with me.Don't worry honey I'll unchain you when I get back from the store.well that's my 2 cents worth.

Morgan \"Light Coach\"","review\/score":"5.0","review\/summary":"Be Of Good Cheer","review\/text":"Sometimes...many times...I get lost in the craziness of the world. As much as I try and remain centered in a place\/a space of Spirit, there are times where I just temporarily forget the Love, the life, the Light that is within me and all around me and I start believing more in the appearances than in what's ultimately real; God. And I can tell when I do. I start feeling heavy. Not just physically, but emotionally. I get grouchy. I find myself getting irritated at the littlest of things and then before I spiral too much out of control, I look for something that helps me remember a deeper meaning to life and a lot of the time I reach for this beautiful and wonderful Holy-day classic.This movie is as old as I am. Actually, I am older by 9 months and nine days (but who's counting)and I really cannot recall the first time I saw it, but I do know that even now when I see it, something magical...something transformative...something wondrous takes place within me. Not just now, now that I am on a conscious and deliberate spiritual path, but always - which can only lead me to conclude that I was on a Spiritual Path even when I thought I wasn't.Charlie Brown finds out the deeper meaning of Christmas and maybe he finds a deeper meaning to life; that appearances are not always what they seem; that through Love, transformation always takes place. When people ask me if I'm \"born again\" I tell them \"sure\". Not in the way that they might think, but I am born again every time I believe in what my heart says more than what the world may tell me. This is why I reach for this film no matter what time of year I may be in. I am reminded of the simple beauty and innocence of Jesus the Christ's teachings; \"Be in the world, but not of it...\" and \"Forgive them, for they know not what they do...\"So many times we know not what we do. We have become so hypnotized into believing in the world that we forget our true identity, our true home. Blessed now are we the children of God and it is this God of Love in which we live and move and have all of our being just as this Love lives within us, moves with us, and has all of its being within us, as us.Y'see, it matters not how old something may be or how many times you think you might have seen something, if you're always gettting something wonderful out of something, then it is still a valid part of your life. That is why I am reviewing this classic in February. Christmas is not a once-a-year thing; whenever the innocence of Christ is being renewed in your heart, the \"savior\" is being born. Be humble enough to receive Its Love, and gracious enough to carry it out into the world.Peace and Blessings be to you and yours this Holy-day!","review\/time":"1171152000","review\/userId":"A1AT0GONN4A9","tipo":"neutral"},

Basically, Charlie Brown is upset that Xmas has become too commercialised. He wants to enjoy it but can't because of the shallow, money-grabbing opportunity he sees all around him.The gang try to cheer him up by letting them direct their Xmas play. He finds it a major stain at first but soon finds it easy being an artistic tyrant. But they need an Xmas tree and the only one Charlie can afford is practically a twig. It needs a lot of love, which the gang sure do give it.Also this TV special also features something damn rare in Xmas movies these days; an actual dedication to Jesus. Now, I am not a puritan Christian but there are sooooo many movies that try to find the TRUE meaning of Xmas but none ever mention the birth of Jesus. Weird eh? Definitely one of the better Xmas specials and miles better thanMr. Magoo's Christmas Carolor Denver the Last Dinosaur Saves Santa.As for It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown when compared to the original this special seems to be less social commentary and more an excuse for gags. It's more cartoonish and has more obvious laughs rather than any irony or important things to say.There's another Xmas play in this 'un. Peppermint Patty is refusing to do any homework and is annoyed that Marcie is playing Mary and she is left with the thankless role of a sheep. Still, she's determined to steal as much scenery as possible. Charlie Brown is selling his old comics to buy an Xmas present for his wannabe girlfriend and his sister Sally has only one word to say in the play 'HARK' but she ends up yelling 'HOCKEY STICK' instead.More like a series of Peanuts vignettes than a real TV special. But still nice.Both specials are presented in 1.37:1 1080p and are much more vibrant and colourful than their DVD counterparts. A documentary on the history of the main feature is also included as well as a bunch of trailers. The Blu Ray comes boxed in a nice looking, glittery slip case. Definitely one for collectors.","review\/time":"1103932800","review\/userId":"A319SKSB5560","tipo":"neutral"},

And it will sell - it's a perennial Christmas classic, and deserves every accolade. But...something is missing...The original sponsor of this special was Coca-Cola, and, like many television programs and specials of the time, had sponsor bumpers in the program. Linus crashed into a \"sponsored by Coca-Cola\" sign, slingshotted his blanket at Coke cans, and the end credits wished us all a \"Merry Christmas from your Coca-Cola bottlers\". Due to broadcast regulation changes, children's programming could no longer include direct sponsoring, and the Coke references disappeared forever after the original broadcast. Therefore, unless somebody wants to pay Coca-Cola a huge amount of money, you will never see these portions, either restored or as extras for a true collector's edition. If you own a Paramount copy, don't worry about updating your disc.Oh, and the greatest Peanuts holiday special is coupled with the very worst Peanuts holiday special - it has never aired on network television outside of its original broadcast.

The reason? This new version is out of sync. In other words, the mouth movements of the characters as they speak no longer properly match the actual voices you hear on the audio track. If you already own this version, watch yours carefully; you'll see what I mean. There's a noticeable lag. If you're considering buying this DVD, you might want to wait until Warner Bros. gets its team back to the drawing board and amends this annoying error. Perhaps such a flaw won't bother some viewers; but if you're like me, it will detract from the beauty of this classic every time you watch.","review\/time":"1229040000","review\/userId":"A38DYU66AWME","tipo":"negativo"},

A Solinas \"ea_solinas\"","review\/score":"5.0","review\/summary":"Sure, Charlie Brown. I can tell you what Christmas is all about","review\/text":"Everybody gets that feeling -- the disillusionment with Christmas' glitzy, soulless commercial barrage.The antidote to that can be found in \"A Charlie Brown Christmas,\" where everyone's favorite round-headed kid tries to find out the real meaning of Christmas. Simply animated and told, this special little story reminds us why we have Christmas, without resorting to sentimental goop or silly humor. It's both funny and heartwarming.Charlie Brown is depressed. It's Christmastime, and he knows he should be happy, but instead he feels let down. Even worse, everyone is into the commercial aspect of it -- even his dog! When he asks Lucy for help, she offers him a job as a pageant director. He agrees, hoping it will get him in the spirit.Of course, it's a disaster -- Snoopy mimicks and licks Lucy, Pigpen grosses out his onstage \"wife,\" and everyone dances to Schroeder's piano. Finally Charlie Brown goes out to buy a big glitzy Christmas tree, but he ends up buying a tiny scraggly one instead. As the others laugh at him and his poor little tree, he cries out, \"Isn't there ANYONE who can tell me what Christmas is all about?\" And Linus tells him.This DVD also contains a sequel special, \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.\" Instead of a real storyline, it's a series of light subplots and vignettes, based on the comic strips by Charles Schultz. It's not as striking as the original, but it is lots of fun.As the story goes on, Peppermint Patty struggles with her holiday book reports, and Linus tries unsuccessfully to tell Sally about the meaning of Christmas. Charlie Brown tries unsuccessfully to peddle wreaths door to door (\"It isn't even Thanksgiving yet!\"), and sells his comic book collection so he can buy his crush a pretty pair of gloves.And finally, there's an upcoming holiday pageant -- Sally has been cast as an angel, with only a one-word line: \"Hark!\" She messes up, of course. And Peppermint Patty hopes to be cast in the role of Mary, but is shocked to find out that Marcie has been cast instead (\"Mary never wore GLASSES!\")... and that she's gotten the role of a sheep.\"Charlie Brown Christmas\" is sort of an antidote to those wretched Christmas specials they trot out every year . It was made with a shoestring budget and a jazz soundtrack, and after seeing it, the network executives believed it would be a massive flop. Well, shows what they knew.There's something in Charlie Brown's search for yuletide meaning that really yanks the heartstrings. Not to mention the climactic moment when Charlie Brown cries out for the meaning of Christmas -- Linus calmly announces that he can tell him. He goes up to the podium, and quietly reads from a relevant Bible passage. \"Fear not, for behold, I bring unto you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people...\" Its simplicity is what makes it so beautiful.But there's lots of humor too -- birds dancing with candy canes, Sally's Christmas demands, and disastrous holiday pageants (\"Woof! Meow! Moo! Whatever!\" yells Peppermint Patty in her sheep costume). One of the most entertaining subplots is poor Linus repeatedly trying to tell Sally about the meaning of Christmas, only to have her say angrily, \"If I get socks again for Christmas, I'll get even MORE crazy!\"Whether it's for the nostalgic value or the message, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" is sure to entertain. An absolute must-have.","review\/time":"1164499200","review\/userId":"A1D2C0WDCSHU","tipo":"positivo"},

As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no artifacts, good sound. Skip the second feature, \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.\" It just doesn't compare. My only gripe about the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my attention and my heart. Every year, I watched for the moment when the Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began singing \"Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo\" to the tune of \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing.\" As the camera pulls in on the left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one frame when they all take a breath. You can see Patty's orange dress suddenly appear where his head was. I was really sorry to see them fix that. I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to me.","review\/time":"968716800","review\/userId":"A11046XQ40ND","tipo":"positivo"},

In terms of entertainment, we have costumes, parades, and the Rockettes, along with numerous television specials and holiday music releases. However, nothing captures the pop culture spirit of the season like the Charlie Brown TV specials. Good old Chuck, Linus and Lucy, Snoopy, and the rest of the Peanuts gang epitomize the holidays like no one else.In terms of holiday music, you can't do better than the soundtracks to the Charlie Brown specials. As enjoyable as holiday releases by major and independent artists can be, they don't compare to the beauty and innocence of the scores for the Peanuts specials. There are several albums that cover the music of the Peanuts shows, but I really recommend the actual soundtracks to the programs composed and performed by Vince Gauraldi. Like the shows, his timeless Charlie Brown recordings exude the peace, contentment, and happiness of the holidays.","review\/time":"1354838400","review\/userId":"A2TWT7ZPBBYZ","tipo":"positivo"},

However, Linus wraps his blanket around the tree, making it look healthier almost instantly. But it is only when the meaning of Christmas is explained to the Peanuts gang that they actually seem to get it. The classic reading of the Christmas story compliments the program nicely. All in all, it is a good show that shows that Christmas is not all about the shopping and gifts, but something deeper.","review\/time":"1355961600","review\/userId":"A2NRXUPUSBZ2","tipo":"neutral"},

Still Relevant After All These Years!","review\/text":"For a 25 min made-for-tv cartoon of the mid-60's, this is truly a timeless classic whose message is still all so relevant more than 40 years later. Both the main feature, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" and the bonus \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\" are destined to be viewed at Yuletide for many more decades to come. As one among the very many people in my social circle who bemoan the loss of the true meaning of Christmas and with the wanton commercialisation behind it all, I was pleasantly surprised to see a couple of cartoons that address this issue so well and in such simple terms that even a child could understand the distinction. The main feature brings out the message better than the bonus and it's no surprise at all that this is a very worthy winner of both the Emmy and Peabody awards. The only reason this dvd doesn't get all 5 stars from me is that despite the digital remastering, the sound quality isn't perfect and is in mono format and the video quality is affected by transfer from a deteriorating master source. But these are small complaints and do not detract too much from the enjoyment of all but the more picky video and audiophile. I note that they have attempted to do a better remastering for the Grinch and perhaps those concerned may attempt something similar with this dvd as well. In addition, with a total run time of about 50 minutes, you'd expect a lot more special features or documentaries about the main features but these unfortunately are not present here. Overall, despite these limitations of the disc, you would be hard-pressed to find a better way to explain to your kids what the true meaning of Christmas is.

Charlie Brown's angst about the Christmas season is profound, but it's gotten even worse forty years later. The interesting thing about his troubles with the holiday season is that Schultz treats it with such tenderness while keeping a biting commentary on it in the process. That's hard to pull off.The only thing that can be said about negative aspects of this fun little short is that the animation is starting to look jerky and dated. However, when it comes down to it, it's not like anyone should care.This DVD also includes It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown!, a follow-up short made in the 90s. It's not as good, nor as relevant, but it's still sweet and hey, it has Snoopy. Snoopy always makes everything go from good to great.

Made in 1965, this movie has withstood the test of time and still remains one of the best Christmas programs of all time. It put Peanuts and Vince Guaraldi on the map. The Vince Guaraldi Trio composed the soundtrack to this film which, in my opinion, is the best Christmas album ever. Not only is it entertaining, it has a simple, but important message: Love and togetherness is the true meaning of Christmas, not presents, decorations, and fancy Christmas productions. If you celebrate the feeling of Christmas, then you don't need all that superficial stuff. Charles Shultz was a genius in his own way. He found a way to deliver important (sometimes grown-up) ideas to kids so they can understand them better. Since it only airs once a year, this video is essential to your movie collection. The soundtrack is DEFINATELY an essential to your CD collection. I love to put up the decorations and tree to the music. It makes for a very sentimental holiday. The only downside to the video is that it is only 30 minutes long. But it doesnt take away from its message.

This one is it! Purchase this & none other! 'Charlie Brown Christmas' has never looked & sounded better. This is all the 'stuff' that is Christmas, at least up through 1965. Winter snow, ice-skating, snow-ball throwing, Christmas list to Santa, the nativity play & a not-so-great yet real tree... &, of course, a real lengthy scriptural passage read by Linus! Now it wouldn't be Schulz if there weren't his characters' cynicism, materialistic concessions & rants! This is the first real collaboration for Schulz, Melendez, Mendleson & the great Vince Guaraldi (music). And it was all conceived & completed in 6-months!!! This unimaginable, limited amount of time actually worked in its success in that it looks nothing like Disney, Looney Toons &\/or a pedestrian children's Saturday cartoon.Schulz insisted that the integrity & look of his strip be evident in every frame which allowed Melendez (an ex-Disney animator) to move the gang statically (much like how 'South Park' would look years later), complete w\/asides & glaring close-ups... cheating, if you will, & yet establishing a sort of compromised 'strip-vs.-cartoon' hybrid. It gave it its look (which, by the way, lost its trademark style in the early '70's... ugh! What happened!?!)The other remarkable element are the voices themselves in that real children voices were used on the soundtrack. Here we have the best, most memorable voices in all the decades of this (or any other) animation. Christopher Shea (as Linus) & Peter Robbins (as Charlie Brown) are the only voices... the only...! Even sister Sally's voice is the best. In later installments the children sound like they're reading a script as hired professionals. on 'Christmas' they sound authentically conversational, witty, sarcastic & 'charlie-browny'!!! They all were really funny too! Just like real kids (w\/adult minds!)Guaraldi's classic 'Linus & Lucy' is used effectively in the dance at the school auditorium, as is his gorgeous 'ChristmasTime Is Here' so perfect to open the skating Peanuts gang! Guaraldi is a genius with his remarkable use of jazz & melody on nearly all his Peanuts' scores. This one is particularly great, as sales of the CD soundtrack each & every year prove still sell so well (get the 2006 remaster!)Of course, the reading of the gospel of Luke is not only remarkable for that time, but in the decades after, it's so necessarily touching for this holiday! Only Linus can do this each & every year! Even though I'm agnostic it brings a warm feeling to me everytime I hear it... His lispy recitation is letter perfect & something only Charles Schulz can do through his signature cartoon character(s)! It brings every year to a special (& tearful) hault!The only 'Christmas' classic w\/great schdicky animation & script... a pot-pourri of all things Christmas, never to be topped again (except 'Polar Express'!). This re-release also includes 'The Making of...' & it's exciting to learn & watch. The added special 'Christmas Time Again' really lacks the magic of the original '65 classic as do nearly all the others after the '60's. Only nostalgia & chuckles... good grief!We love you Charles Schulz... come back to us... & if you can't, at least we have this one-of-a-kind classic each & every year.","review\/time":"1353024000","review\/userId":"AZATETBWVZX8","tipo":"positivo"},

The cartoon is not just about Charlie Brown being depressed and called a blockhead (although that inevitably happens). It's a message about what Christmas is really all about.The cartoon acknowledges commercialism (Christmas is run by a big Eastern conglomerate!) but is totally okay with thumbing its collective animated nose at that and instead involves the viewer into the true meaning of Christmas.There is a jab at the psychiatric industry as well. Lucy gets her nickel from Charlie Brown and then says, \"Let's see what's wrong with you and then we can put a label on it.\" And then she proceeds to list all kinds of phobias. Funny stuff.The Christmas play is great, with awesome jazzified Christmas music by Vince Guaraldi as composer, and Linus' speech on stage.This special had Coca Cola as the main sponsor and so some scenes were cut that had the Coca Cola parts in it.So as Linus warns Charlie Brown, don't make Christmas a problem and just enjoy it. The TV special really shows the simplicity of Christmas.Recommended:The Vince Guaraldi Collection: arranged by Phillip Keveren Phillip Keveren SeriesThe Peanuts Illustrated Songbook","review\/time":"1260576000","review\/userId":"A1C58YXM2A30","tipo":"positivo"},

Charlie Brown's disgust at the commercialization of Christmas is ever more relevant---never mind that the show was originally produced in the 1960's.I could always relate to Charlie Brown. He is a nice guy who really tries hard to do the right thing--but is underappreciated by his classmates just for being himself. His really big heart prompts a tree rescue and philosophical search for holiday meaning, itself a pretty admirable task for an animated special which could have done a less ambitious script.Linus's school auditorium speech is supposed to get audiences in the show--and at home--thinking about the non-commercial side of Christmas.

Even though it was written in the 60's, it is amazing how resonating a story about the over commercialization of Christmas still is today. From the tin Christmas trees to Linus thinking that the holiday is run by an \"eastern syndicate\", you could use these kind of things to apply to today (attention wal-mart shoppers). Though far from being a religious person, I still love Linus' speech about the true meaning of Christmas and it is interesting to learn the advertisers back in the day worried the cartoon was too religious for the viewing audience. Definitely a must see for the holiday season and it teaches kids a great lesson.","review\/time":"1133222400","review\/userId":"ADGMIWM567TF","tipo":"positivo"},

This Beloved Classic Needs Some TLC!","review\/text":"Maybe the reason Charlie Brown was feeling depressed around Christmas was because he saw this DVD. While I'd give \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" 6 stars if I could for the show itself, the poor quality DVD that's on the market is another story: it rates 2 stars at best. Surely a program that's so loved by so many deserves the TLC of a proper remastering, and it's hard to understand why it hasn't happened.This year I bought my three favorite Christmas classics on DVD: Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, How the Grinch Stole Christmas and Charlie Brown. The first two were recently remastered and the results were stunning--better in every way than I've ever seen them look and sound on television. And I'm not talking about a \"modernizing\" of these shows that turned them into something different in character than they were--no, these remasters are loving and faithful restorations of these classics to their original glory. By comparison, A Charlie Brown Christmas was a huge disappointment. The video is passable, but having seen what restoration did for the Grinch animation, I'm also aware of how much better the Charlie Brown video could be. The audio, however, is atrocious--an embarrassment, really, especially considering all the great Charles Schulz dialogue and the incomparable Vince Guaraldi score. It's hissy, it's muddy, it's mixed poorly and sound levels can vary widely.The size of the fan base for this show would virtually guarantee financial success for a remastered DVD-I'm not sure who owns the rights to do something like that, but I hope they're reading this review!","review\/time":"1198540800","review\/userId":"AJ34DZU9MYMU","tipo":"positivo"},

As for the DVD edition, it's a good transfer, clean, no artifacts, good sound. Skip the second feature, \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.\" It just doesn't compare. My only gripe about the DVD: they fixed the one moment in the original master that captured my attention and my heart. Every year, I watched for the moment when the Peanuts gang gathered around the newly decorated little tree and began singing \"Loo loo loo, loo loo loo loo loo\" to the tune of \"Hark the Herald Angels Sing.\" As the camera pulls in on the left side of the group and pans right, Pig Pen's head disappears for one frame when they all take a breath. You can see Patty's orange dress suddenly appear where his head was. I was really sorry to see them fix that. I don't know why, but it makes the cartoon even more endearing to me.","review\/time":"968716800","review\/userId":"A11046XQ40ND","tipo":"positivo"},

Work was done in just 4 months flat (considering the lot of work that goes into an animated feature) and a lot of money and resources were put at stake. Lucky for them - and a lot of us - \"Sparky\" hit the nail on the head. This film was the absolute winner of next year's Emmy awards for television for kids programming, along with more accolades and recognitions. I think the different treatment of the Christmas theme present on this film has captured interest across generations and, in true Peanuts' style, is something that makes you ponder beyond the obvious.

The commercialism of the season, a mailbox always lacking Christmas cards and his little sister's monetary demands to Santa make Chuck wonder if Christmas is really something to anticipate. Unable to get any good advice from a therapy session with Lucy, Charlie Brown seems destined to be miserable through the holidays. Of all the Charlie Browns in the world, he is indeed the Charlie Browniest.To cheer him up, the gang puts Charlie Brown in charge of a very weird Christmas pageant that features a Christmas Queen, Beethoven music, a few people dressed as nativity characters and a stage full of dancers doing the same dance steps over and over and over. But Orson Welles he is not, and Chuck fails as a director.His pals give him one last chance to redeem himself by putting him in charge of procuring a Christmas tree. It is at this moment that the show makes a drastic switch in tone and ambition. The opening acts are full of silly set-ups and easy jokes. But as Chuck and his faithful pal Linus set out toward the Christmas tree lot, the narrative slows and strives for poignancy.The perpetually needle-shedding little tree they obtain and Linus's eventual speech on the true meaning of Christmas have become iconic moments for the holiday season. Linus himself seems to guide the last half of the show, as the baby-faced blankie-wielding introvert swoops in and steals Charlie Brown's Christmas special from him. Linus sees the potential for greatness in the little tree, believing it only needs some love. Indeed, the eternal optimism and right-mindedness of Charlie Brown's best friend transforms the show from a gloomy diatribe against modern Christmas to a declaration on the potential for beauty and wonder to blossom everywhere during the Christmas season.","review\/time":"1133308800","review\/userId":"A17JVVAKWEB0","tipo":"positivo"},

I alternated as a kid identifying the most with poor, picked-on, stumble-plagued Charlie Brown and bookish, thoughtful, sibling-harassed Linus van Pelt. In the wrong hands, animating these beloved characters (quite possibly the greatest ever created for a comic strip) for the first time could have been disastrous. God must surely have guided \"Sparky\" Schulz to the gentle-hearted animation team of Bill Melendez and Lee Mendelsohn, who gave his creation the care and love it deserved; and them, in turn, to jazz great Vince Guaraldi for his inspired musical score (where do you think that famous PEANUTS theme music -- \"Linus & Lucy\" -- first came from?).Read Mendelsohn's out-of-print 1970 book, CHARLIE BROWN & CHARLIE SCHULZ, or the more recent A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS anniversary-edition book for the full story behind the making of this timeless classic -- and the tremendous risks they took in making it the way they did and airing it that first time on CBS in 1965. You'll appreciate its magic, humor and warmth all the more when you know how perilously close it came to not being made or aired at all -- or worse, bombing in the Nielsen ratings and preventing the making of all the specials, feature films and even Broadway musicals (!) that followed.All the silliness and the sentimentality only serve to make it more of an enduring treasure. And that powerful, climactic moment, when the gang's resident philosopher, Linus (what an utterly fitting choice!), takes poor lost Charlie Brown and friends -- and all of us -- back to old school on the real reason for the season, with that sweet, simple reading of a few lines from the King James Gospel of Luke, can still move even a jaded, bitter \"recovering Catholic\" like me to tears. It remains the finest artistic rebuke to the ever-worsening commercialization of Christendom's holiest day since Stan Freberg's edgier, more satirical audio recording \"Green Chri$tma$\" of a decade earlier (and sadly, both are even more relevant today than they were back then).If only poor Mr. Schulz could have lived to see his baby reach this milestone anniversary. It consoles me to know that, at the end of his life, all the cards, letters and E-mails he got in hospital surely made him realize that he had created something for the ages, to last well beyond his own lifetime. May new generations of children take A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS -- and all the rest of the wonderful world of PEANUTS -- to their hearts forevermore...and grow up to share them with their own kids.","review\/time":"1130889600","review\/userId":"A1QRG2KDQZ0X","tipo":"positivo"},

I was lucky enough to view all three of them on their initial airdates, and each year thereafter including this past year. I was already a big \"Peanuts\" enthusiast for several years, besides reading it in the daily paper; I also collected paperback anthologies of the comic strips that I believe cost all of $1.25 per copy. So, when \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" debuted on CBS on Thursday December 9, 1965, I was right there in front of the television set, even though I was seeing it in glorious black and white. My parents didn't buy a color set for another couple of years. Regardless, I loved it and still do; it wouldn't be Christmas without viewing it at least once. This past Christmas I both watched it on network television just to keep my hand in so to speak, and also on this DVD. Commercial free and unedited the DVD wins hands down!What makes this a timeless classic that remains evergreen fresh over 46 years past it's original showing? To begin at the beginning, let's credit cartoonist Charles Schulz who cobbled together some scenes from past Christmas strips along with some fresh, original ideas into a sweet, simple story that had a universal appeal. He wanted the snowy background, remembering his boyhood winters in Minnesota. More importantly he was a deeply religious man. It also was he who insisted on retaining Linus' glorious recitation of the Christmas Gospel of St. Luke, even though Bill Melendez, the animator\/director was nervous that it might be considered \"too religious\" for network television. Schulz's frank, firm response settled the issue once and for all, \"Bill, if we don't do it, who else can? We're the only ones that can do it.\" Thank goodness, he prevailed that soliloquy is the heart and soul of the special.Schulz was also concerned that the simplicity and integrity of his comic strip characters be retained; he didn't want them elaborately animated or \"Disneyfied\". Here Executive Producer Lee Mendelson and Animator\/Director Bill Melendez stepped in making sure that Charlie Brown and Company would move and speak but remain as close as possible to their appearance in the strip, not be fleshed out and three dimensional with lots of detail. The background settings were simply drawn and executed as well.The third element was a memorable, beautifully executed musical score by renowned jazz musician Vince Guaraldi that perfectly caught the mood of the piece, enhancing the action and that has become a modern classic. Besides the wonderful opening song \"Christmastime is Here\", the most renowned composition is \"Linus and Lucy\" which accompanies all the gang as they dance joyously on the stage of the school during the rehearsal for the Christmas pageant. I have a fond memory myself of a company Christmas party about twenty years ago when a group of friends and myself were on the dance floor and the DJ played this cut, and someone shouted \"Hey, everyone dance like \"Peanuts\"!\" and instantly we all started dancing like the different characters! I took the part of the nameless boy with the spikey hair that turned to the right and left while shrugging his shoulders up and down.Another important factor was that actual kids the approximate ages of the \"Peanuts\" gang were used to supply the voices. this was quite refreshing, most times up to now adults had supplied the vocals for children in animation with the exception of the Disney films. Having real children added immersurably to the authenticity and naturalness. Kudos all round to this young group of actors but most especially to Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown, Christopher Shea as Linus, Tracy Stafford as Lucy and Kathy Steinburg as Sally Brown, who all captured the essence of their characters. They were all marvelous actors as well, particularly young Master Shea who brought a wellspring of emotion and depth of feeling to his recitation of the Nativity Gospel. I can pay them no higher compliment than to say they sounded just the way I'd imagined their characters would. The lone adult to lend his voice was Mr. Melendez who proved to be an inspired choice for the unique sound of Snoopy and later Woodstock as well.One of my own personal reasons that this remains my favorite of all the \"Peanuts\" specials and movies is that it features the original characters from the first years of the strip: Charlie Brown, Patty, Shermy, Violet, Schroeder, Lucy, Linus, Pig-Pen and of course Snoopy. Regrettably, in a few years time Mr. Schulz would phase out Patty, Shermy, Violet and to a leser degree Pig-Pen, replacing them with Peppermint Patty, Marcy, Woodstock and Rerun whom I personally didn't find as amusing.Now about the bonus featurette \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\". It's a collection of several short vignettes that are all right I suppose, but don't measure to the high standard set by the original, and of course that's why you're buying this DVD.There are many other reasons I love \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", along with \"Rudolph\" and \"The Grinch\",one being it is a touchstone to the Christmas' memories of my childhood, and more recently of my own son's. Not to be hokey, but also I love that it does explain beautifully what Christmas is all about in it's purest essence, and this is an key fact to remember when one is overwhelmed by the sheer commercialism of the holiday. Words somehow seen inadequate to describe it properly, sufficent to say you will laugh merrily, perhaps brush away a tear and feel all warm inside afterwards, don't miss it, either on television or on DVD!","review\/time":"1327449600","review\/userId":"A15IN5H4IATS","tipo":"positivo"},

Also, it had the message that everybody seeked yet it wasn't murky not to see it. It is one of my favorite childhood films of all time and it's a joy to sit down and watch it every year with the family. It's the only Christmas film to make me excited for the season and yet still enjoy why we do celebrate. It's not one of those christmas films you see churned out every year that exploits the season and only has money to gain. I mean, this movie is anti commercial because it's saying that we lost our way in the hustle and bustle of getting gifts for everybody that we have lost the true meaning in WHY we get the gifts. Charlies Shultz could create the most simplistic characters that you could see yourself it. It's a film that needs to be locked into a vault and stored in for protection just so future generations that get lost in the season can simply unearth it and find out why Christmas exists.","review\/time":"1321747200","review\/userId":"A36HBE2C5SQ2","tipo":"positivo"},

But, this deserves special attention. From the start, Charlie grabs us. The truth is that many people get depressed around Christmas; and since Charlie feels that no one likes him, he especially gets depressed. (Holidays always seem to rub it in if we feel alone.) Also, he is disturbed at the huge commercial aspects of Christmas. Charlie is then called upon to direct a Christmas play and get a tree for the play. It is clear that the other children are distant from Charlie, and it is also clear that they expect a tree that will reflect the commercialized aspect of Christmas. He takes a stand and buys the tree that seems to need a friend. Linus' role is very well done here. Notice he does not criticize the tree itself or Charlie's intentions! But he is concerned that Charlie will be taunted for this. The next scene is done well. Charlie tried (even if unkowingly) to bring the true meaning of Christmas into a crowd that concentrated on the commercial aspects. As Linus fears, Charlie was in fact taunted and mocked for carrying the true meaning of Christmas in a commercial society. When Charlie is mocked, Linus (who also seemed to be carrying the true meaning of Christmas) shows bravery and confronts everyone with the true meaning of Christmas. It is almost as if he carried it, but was afraid to unleash it; and when he saw Charlie show bravery that he would be mocked for, he felt he had an obligation to act. Through this, the mood of the children change. So, Charlie and Linus carry the true meaning of Christmas in a society that does not; Charlie is mocked and taunted; Linus feels compelled to step in; the mood of the whole gang changes for the better. Even if you don't really care for The Peanuts, you should watch this.","review\/time":"975801600","review\/userId":"A3EOHYIHQM3K","tipo":"positivo"},

But for an immigrant like me, I only saw it for the first time a few years ago. I knew about Charlie Brown and saw some of the half-hour shows when i was younger. But I did not see the Christmas Special until the early 2000s.I am very fond of this Christmas special. From all the beloved characters to the highly original and very festive jazz soundtrack performed by The Vince Guaraldi Trio; a classic in its own right.But the one moment in the show that still moves me deeply is Linus' speech about the true meaning of Christmas. To quote from the Gospel in a cartoon was extremely daring and met with tremendous resistance when the show was to be aired. But Charles Schultz was steadfast in his determination that nothing be changed from his original idea.So I am watching this Christmas special and laugh occasionally, empathize with Charlie occasionally and find the cartoon mildly humourous. Then there is the moment when Charlie Brown cries out for someone to tell him about the true meaning of Christmas.... and then Linus takes center stage.When little Linus takes the stage, he recites the birth of Jesus as written in the Gospel of Luke in a very undramatic but completely innocent tone. Amazingly, it carries more impact than any sermon from the multitude of preachers, televangelists and bible-preaching ministers I have seen in Church or on TV. There is something truly moving in this narrative, whether you are a Christian or not. The matter of fact way in which Linus recites the Bible, describing the birth of Jesus makes the message more powerful and in the context of the show, very moving.It is one of TV's most iconic moments and it is a scene I can watch over and over and never tire of it. So simple and yet it has endured for nearly 50 years.","review\/time":"1323129600","review\/userId":"A1JJ7BVA5LAV","tipo":"positivo"},

Schulz's timeless gang to the world of television and was awarded both an Emmy and a Peabody award. Originally broadcast December 9, 1965, on CBS -- years before Seasonal Affective Disorder entered our lexicon -- the story is driven by Charlie Brown, sort of a tyro Scrooge made even more miserable by the increasingly crass commercialism of holiday cheer. Charlie agrees to direct the school Christmas pageant and in the process tries to discover the true meaning of the holiday. Although its animation is dated and its evangelism is unsubtle, A Charlie Brown Christmas -- like all the Peanuts holiday specials -- is so good-hearted that it's very easy to overlook its flaws. Linus wrapping his blanket around the tiny, stunted tree remains among the most endearing images ever produced for network television. For grown-ups, this is how Charlie Brown and Snoopy and Sally will always be remembered, stumbling and dancing around the school stage in a childish torrent of goodwill. For kids, the simple charm of the white beagle with black ears and his friends will likely beguile them from here to next Tuesday. The new DVD is unedited and includes footage that was shorn after the initial broadcast, as well as the more recent special, It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown.Also Recommended:M\u00c3\u00a9hdiChristmas Treasures,A True Gem.","review\/time":"1194825600","review\/userId":"ADJTH7ANSK3W","tipo":"positivo"},

I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world...

After moving to the US and hearing so much about it from my friends I decided to buy it for myself to see what all the fuss was about.In short, I loved it! It is the most heartwarming and poignant little Christmas story I have ever seen, and I can understand why it stirs such warm memories in my friends, most of whom are in the 25-35 year old age category. The colours are bright and vivid, and the music is incredibly apt while still being jolly. The early scene where Charlie Brown is standing at the window looking out at the falling snow, while the piano theme plays in the background simply makes you feel better just for having seen it!I suppose it brings back childhood memories for us all, the happiest of which we selectively retain. It was great to be young an innocent, and to have lots of friends, and just enjoy the simplicity of playing in the snow. Charles Schultz knew this, and it permeates all his cartoons - as does his inherent warmth and good naturedness.If you have children, buy this for yourself then pretend it was for them! For my part, I oringinally intended to watch this every Christmastime. Now I just watch it whenever I need cheering up.Granted it is only 25 minutes long, and the sequel is pretty weak sadly, but anything that makes you feel this good is money well spent.

However, the DVD has some very disappointing sound problems that make me hope that this treasure has not been lost forever, and that maybe there is a better version in our future.The program, particularly the audio, seems like it has been poorly \"restored.\" However that restoration is more like amateurish remodeling. Old programs are always a little scratchy sounding. That's OK. However, when an bad effort is made to hide that fact, it can spoil the program. Here is what you get in many instances in this DVD, to distacting annoyance:The children are speaking, with soft jazz music in the background. Where there is a moment without a syllable, the sound level drops, like the volume was turned down for just that moment. Not only does this suck the atmosphere out of the program, and generate noticable odd silent spots in a program with acceptable old fashioned tape hiss at all other moments, but it spoils the wonderful musical background, making it go quiet when you are supposed to hear it. This occurs throughout the program.Less of a concern is that there are a few \"glitches\" where several frames seem to be lost, which is jarring, especially when the music jumps. Also, at the end, the final credits music awkwardly fades out before it is over. I understand that there had been a commercial logo originally that they did not want to include, but they should have let the music continue. Perhaps someone just chopped it off of the print, and the fade is to avoid the chop.I hope that somewhere there is a better print to work with, so that the full joy of this program can be savored.Until then, I'll enjoy the wonderful Vince Guaraldi music on the CD, which has excellent sound quality.","review\/time":"1135123200","review\/userId":"A1OB6J334UYE","tipo":"positivo"},

I recall watching it as far back as twenty-two years ago, and have watched it every Christmas since.\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" was made in a time when commercialism was running rampant all over the country. Stores advertising to shoppers what they ought to buy, long before Thanksgiving had come and gone. Unfortunately, we still see this blatant commercialism today, which makes this short film so very poignant and all the more special.Charlie Brown is assigned to direct the school Christmas pageant, much to his glee; for he feels accepted and worthy. When Lucy tells him to go out and get an alumminum tree, he takes Linus along with him. What Charlie Brown ultimately gets is a small, sickly looking tree, which is rapidly loosing its needles. But, Charlie can see how much the tree \"needs him\", somebody; something which he can identity with.When he returns, he finds the gang dancing to un-Christmas like music, instead of rehearsing their lines. They stop to take a look at the tree he brought, immediately burtsing out in mocking laughter. Apparently Charlie Brown has failed again. In disgust and humiliation he flees, taking the tree with him. And when he comes upon Snoopy's dog house, all decked out in Christmas lights, not to celebrate the joyous holiday, but to win money in a contest, Charlie Brown has had enough, and almost loses all faith in Christmas.Linus saves the day, somehow able to bring the tree back to life, and make it look much healthier and stronger. But it is when he explains the meaning of Christmas that the \"gang\" gets the point of Christmas, and what Charlie Brown was trying to do.\"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" ends with newfound meaning for Christmas, hopefully not soon forgotten by either the Peanuts Gang, or, more importantly ... us.","review\/time":"1005696000","review\/userId":"A3O9LMY2DTV2","tipo":"positivo"},

Ever since I was a little boy, this has been my favorite Christmas special, and one that I always looked forward to watching every year. I grew up reading the Peanuts comic strips and I grew up watching the Peanuts Christmas special.Charlie Brown is depressed. He can't seem to get himself into the Christmas spirit. He doesn't like the commercialism of Christmas and scarcely knows the true meaning of Christmas. Lucy selects Charlie Brown to be the director of their Christmas play and he decides to get a Christmas tree for the production. The other kids tell him to get a \"nice shiny aluminum tree, maybe a pink one\", but Charlie Brown and Linus bring back a sad looking real tree. Charlie Brown is almost laughed out of the auditorium, but when he asks if anyone knows what Christmas is all about, Linus has the answer. Linus recites a passage from the Bible telling of the birth of Jesus. Charlie Brown is cheered and leaves with the tree. He tries to decorate the little tree, but even that is ruined. Linus and the gang follow behind, fix up the tree, and at the end, they show the true spirit of Christmas.It is a sweet little Christmas special, filled with memorable moments that will always make me smile. The one thing that amazes me is that Charles Schulz was able to include Linus's speech near the end about the birth of Jesus. I don't imagine that would have been able to be included today, but I think the special is all the stronger for it. I have a hard time imagining that any new Christmas show will ever hold as special a place in my heart as \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\".This DVD also includes \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\" (1992). This Christmas feature is lacking the overall charm and emotion of the older special, but it has a lot more humor. It is also different from the first Christmas special in that this one is more a series of vignettes (perhaps based on Schulz's comic strips) than a complete story. There are sequences with Charlie Brown trying to sell Christmas wreaths before Thanksgiving, and of Sally rehearsing for a Christmas play. Sally's sole line is \"Hark!\", though I think she missed the rest of her lines where the herald angels sing. It is a cute cartoon, but ultimately it does not quite live up to \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\", but it my mind, nothing can live up to that one.","review\/time":"1074038400","review\/userId":"A2FEGRJQNU51","tipo":"positivo"},

Also, there is a new 5.1 audio mix that was not on the standard DVD that sounds very engaging.If you already own the remastered DVD, I wouldn't necessarily rush out and buy this.

But now that I have the video, I will never miss it! A friend of mine even gave me the cassette of Vince Guaraldi's musical score to go along with it. Hooray!I'm always touched by the message in the story. Christmas is too commercial. It pains me to see Christmas stuff in the stores before school starts, or to see commercials pandering to children so their parents can buy more stuff. But watching Charlie Brown and the gang reminds me of a simpler time.Snoopy, with his gaudily decorated dog house, represents all that's commercial and greedy about Christmas. Charlie Brown tries to overcome that with his involvement in the school play and his search for the right Christmas tree to set the mood for the play cast members.I love this show. I heard that ABC bought the rights away from CBS for all the Charlie Brown specials.

Even so, this charming animated classic exudes such warmth and genuine holiday spirit that it deserves a permanent place in the collection of anyone who values the true meaning of Christmas and the late Charles M. Schulz's all too human \"Peanuts\" characters.Schulz once said that his legendary comic strip was never intended for children, and \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" may hold greater meaning for adults, especially those who remember it from their childhood. Who can't relate to Charlie Brown and his inability to find joy in the season proclaimed by everyone as the happiest of all? Today, he would likely be diagnosed with SAD (seasonal affective disorder) and put on Prozac to prevent him from wondering what Christmas is all about.But Charles Schulz was wiser than any psychologist, and he recognized Charlie's depression for what it is: a yearning to know life's deeper meaning. He finds it through Linus who shares with him \"the tidings of great joy\" found in Luke 2:10-11. It's a beautiful moment that may explain why this classic remains so beloved in our increasingly secular, cynical world.But there's a lot to love about \"A Charlie Brown Christmas.\" The child actors who voice Charlie Brown (Peter Robbins), Linus (Christopher Shea) and the entire Peanuts gang capture the personalities superbly, Snoopy is at his radical best, and then there's Vince Guaraldi's jazz score, a jewel of perfection that features the beautiful \"Christmas Time Is Here.\"It's been said that art can heal. There's no better proof of that than the work of Charles M. Schulz whose simple drawings combined with a profound understanding of human nature made him one of the greatest healers of all.Brian W.

There are lots of great Christmas movies and TV shows that are fun to watch each year, from CHRISTMAS VACATION to THE GRINCH. But there is something special about Charlie Brown's take.First of all, it's the only mainstream Christmas classic that actually DARES to bring the story of the birth of Jesus to front and center!! When Linus takes centerstage and quotes the bible for us, you can almost feel the air suck out of the room. It's a moment of simple drama that can really bring a tear to your eye. Linus, without saying a harsh word, essentially tells everyone to \"shut up and remember the meaning of this holiday!\" It's a beautiful moment.There's plenty of amusing stuff too. The pitiful tree...Snoopy's hijinks, etc. It's not laugh out loud funny, of course, but sweet and innocent. These are kids who live in a world without adults...and don't seem to need them either! It's always a nice 22 minute trip down memory lane. Every adult should own this...if only to take minute to journey back to childhood. And kids need to keep seeing this. I'm glad it has remained a classic.The animation is no great shakes, of course, but the style is executed marvelously. The voice acting, on the other hand, leaves nothing to be desired. The kids involved have done a terrific job. The music, ever present, is great, as we've come to expect from any Peanuts special. All in all, this is a MUST OWN DVD.(I do wish there were more extras available. Other than a 2nd Christmas special...it's okay, but no classic...there is nothing.

Like many other Christmas specials, I always find myself in high spirits whenever I watch this. Most of the characters from Peanuts are here; the voices are surprisingly effective. The animation is quite simplistic, but it's still beautifully drawn. The humor is very appropriate for this time of year: it's very light and never offensive (if you want crude and offensive, check out Christmas Time in South Park on DVD!). The message is plain and simple: Christmas isn't always about toys and decorations, but most importantly, it's always about the birth of Jesus Christ. I may not be religious, but I'm always moved when Linus explains what Christmas is all about with his truly unforgettable monologue. The monologue itself is delivered in a very straightforward manner, but I think that's the point. It's not dull, nor is it melodramatic. And I think it's the biblical text that makes it all the more powerful.You should definitely check out A Charlie Brown Christmas if you haven't already.

It's been part of my childhood memories since it first aired in 1965. Seeing it again forty years later, I am still impressed by how Charles Schultz combined character-driven humor, holiday-related poignancy and Vince Guaraldi's memorable music into such a nostalgic jewel. What strikes me more now is the number of religious references Schultz made unobtrusively within the theme of the cartoon - how to deal with the increasing commercial exploitation of Christmas. The plot revolves around Charlie Brown's duties as the director of the school's Christmas play as a means to divulge the true meaning of Christmas. I still love the tableaux shot of all the children dancing in a mid-1960's beatnik style.Needless to say, he is surrounded by the cynicism of his schoolmates, and it all comes to a head when Charlie Brown buys a sad little tree as the centerpiece of the play. His best friend Linus articulates the meaning of Christmas by quoting Luke 2:8-14 from the King James translation of the Bible. At the end, everyone gathers around the tree (given new life by using the decorations Snoopy uses to win 1st prize in the doghouse decoration contest) and sings \"Hark! The Herald Angel Sings\". Because the cartoon focuses on Charlie Brown's singular journey, the message has a sweetly-turned resonance that remains touching to this day. It's a timeless must-see for any child or adult.The same really can't be said for the second cartoon included in the DVD, 1992's \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\". Twenty-seven years later, most of the gang is back in what amounts to a series of vignettes about Christmas, but because Charlie Brown is only one of the characters whose holiday dilemmas are addressed here, it feels more like a hodgepodge of comedy bits - some funny, some rather tired. The other sad inevitable fact is that the voices are different, a point of discontinuity that feels a bit jarring when seeing the cartoons sequentially. I also miss some of the original characters like Pig-Pen and Beethoven-playing Schroeder and frankly don't find some of their replacements as likeable.Charlie Brown's only challenge this time is being able to afford a pair of gloves for his crush Peggy Jean. It appears that Peppermint Patty and Charlie Brown's little sister Sally are the ones trying to find the meaning of Christmas this time with many of the other characters (like Lucy and even Snoopy) relegated to small bits. The familiarity of the characters and Guaraldi's music, however, still make this one leagues better than similar children's programming. The combination of the original classic and this derivative makes for superior viewing.","review\/time":"1134691200","review\/userId":"A13E0ARAXI6K","tipo":"positivo"},

Then came DVD, and now we have this lovely Blu-Ray edition.Prospective buyers should note that the movie does not play in the full-screen format of many Blu-Rays. I assume that this is because the film was created for television and thus the aspect ratio was different. \"Charlie Brown\" shorts are not exactly known for sweeping visual quality in the first place; the style is sparse and simple, and that's what so many people, myself included, love about it. Despite the fact that the television screen isn't filled, the clarity of the picture is exceptionally vivid, putting our old VHS copy to shame. The special features include some interesting behind-the-scenes material, likely to delight any and all longtime fans of the film. The second feature included, \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\" gets very little play in our home. It just never caught on or made the same impact as the original, both with my family and the general public. Nonetheless, it's nice that it was included, it gives you just that much more bang for your buck.I'd highly recommend this to any new or longtime fans of \"Peanuts.\" If you're anything like me, \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" is essential holiday viewing, and this Blu-Ray is a great way to view it!","review\/time":"1357516800","review\/userId":"A3LMVQ8BTEL4","tipo":"positivo"},

Why do we need a holiday to emphasize it?\" Whether we are willing to admit this or not, Charlie Brown's attitude towards Christmas here is quite common. Lucy seems to be just a bit nicer in this episode. She offers to help Charlie Brown find involvement by having him direct a Christmas play.From here, Charlie seems to get upset about the commercialized aspects of Christmas. (Even Sally wants $10.s and $20.s from Santa.) Later, we go to the play being rehearsed. Charlie feels that no one has the spirit of Christmas. (Though Charlie himself is not quite sure what it is.) The gang needs a tree, and Charlie and Linus go to get one. It is interesting that Linus all of a sudden backs Charlie's feelings: \"Christmas is not only getting too commercial, it's getting too dangerous.\" They find a tree that looks on the frail side, but Charlie does not hesitate for a moment to pick it. It is interesting that Linus DOES NOT rebuke Charlie for his choice, but he DOES WARN Charlie that his choice may not be appreciated.(In other words, 'You're doing a nice thing, but don't expect to be popular for it.')Naturally, Charlie is mocked and scorned for his compassion rooted choice. At this point, Linus reveals the true meaning of Christmas. (A fragment of \"Luke\" 2:1-20 which is usually used for the Christmas mass.) This is when the gang starts to realize that Charlie did a wonderful thing (showing compassion) that kept with the spirit of Christmas.My one slight complaint is that a comment Linus makes at the start seems inconsistent with his character: \"Charlie Brown, you're the only one I know who can take a wonderful season like Christmas and turn it into a problem.\" Throughout the episode, Linus seems aware that Christmas has become too commercialized and in some ways has gotten dangerous. To say nothing of the true meaning being lost, and someone may be scorned (as Charlie Brown was) for trying to uphold the true meaning of Christmas.","review\/time":"1232496000","review\/userId":"A1YB29BIDULE","tipo":"positivo"},

When this scene ends, it slowly stops snowing and Charlie Brown goes to Lucy's Psychiatric Help stand. This explains the abruptness in the network broadcasts and older videocassette releases when one moment it's snowing and the next it's not as well as the obvious cut in the background music.

And celebrating my favorite holiday, no less.Despite my \"advanced\" age, I still thoroughly enjoyed the show, even if my ability to appreciate it was substantially limited to Snoopy's antics and Schroeder's exasperation in finding a version of \"Jingle Bells\" suitable to the reigning fussbudget, Lucy Van Pelt.As my age truly advances, it becomes even more enjoyable to find more layers to the cartoon. Much as the Warner Brothers classic cartoons were not truly written for children, but for the writers' own amusement, a more adult view of Charles Schulz's work reveals that this really isn't kiddie fodder.In a way, Vince Guaraldi's score illustrates the point perfectly. Out in front is the \"Linus and Lucy\" theme, a bouncy tune to which any age can be-bop along. Contrast that with \"Christmastime Is Here\"; the lyrics are cheerful, joyful, perfectly descriptive of a child's delight at the season's arrival.And yet, the tune belies the sentiment. It is nearly hopeful, yet somber, knowing it's missing something but not sure what that might be. Just like Charlie Brown's dilemma throughout everyone else's festivities.The only real disappointment on this disc would be the bonus feature \"It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown\", which looks more like a series of largely unrelated continuity-independent vignettes from the 1980's Saturday morning \"Charlie Brown and Snoopy\", slapped together to form the illusion of a featurette, than a coherent story deserving of co-starring with the original.Nonetheless, having the original on DVD alone is worth the investment. Definitely a must-have.","review\/time":"1000252800","review\/userId":"ANMCULAD9KZ7","tipo":"positivo"},

So, my review is a little biased.I just think it's a cute, straightforward, and humorous take on the Christmas season. It brings all our favorite Peanuts characters out at their best, and it makes light of the stress and struggle that we all seem to feel a little of a Christmas - then, brings it home with the most honest recognition of what Christmas is all about. How about that for a 26 minute run-time animated movie?!This is a great edition of the movie as well - excellent picture quality, excellent sound quality (VINCE GUARALDI IS AWESOME!!!) - there is a bonus feature movie on the DVD as well but I didn't even get to it, nor did I get to any of the other special features, but I'm pretty sure there are quite a few on this DVD.Also, I bought direct from Amazon, and I have to give yet another shout-out to the prices and especially the shipping. If you are an Amazon Prime member: they offered me free overnight shipping OR free two day shipping + and Amazon Instant Movie credit instead. I took the 2-day shipping plus credit and I STILL got my movies the next day! I hope they keep offering that.","review\/time":"1357084800","review\/userId":"AO5XQ0P0WB7M","tipo":"positivo"},

The names \"God\" and \"Christ\" actually spoken!). Today, the script would not pass muster at the networks. We might offend someone, you know. I can't think of a better indicator than this great program to measure the decline of our society. I guess when the moral busybodies finally succeed in removing \"A Charlie Brown Christmas\" from the annual rotation (and they will eventually attempt to do so, in the name of \"multiculturalism\" or \"tolerance\"), we can close the book on our once-great country.","review\/time":"1069977600","review\/userId":"unknown","tipo":"positivo"},

The most ubiquitous device upon which you can load digital copies is the iPod; the iPod is a Macintosh product. It stands to reason that digital copies would be compatible with Macs (as indeed every other digital copy I've ever experienced has been). But NO, not with this one. Preposterous. The next thing that was upsetting was that the price you pay for this is far, far too high for the limited content. By way of comparison, for one dollar more, we purchased the Star Trek movie (the new one) Blu-ray edition; it is a 3-disc special edition with over three hours of special features, plus a digital copy (that works on PC AND Macs!!!!). With this, you get two discs; the episode in Blu-ray and a standard DVD of the episode; an additional crappy Peanuts Christmas special (truly awful), a 10 minute making-of featurette; and of course the useless digital copy.

I was very happy when it was released on VHS, and being that it is on DVD now, that's even better.Living in Southern California, often we're having a heat wave during the Christmas season. It's nice to watch this show and be carried away not only to a place that has more Christmas-like weather, but also to nice memories of Christmas past. It's a given that my Christmas tradition includes a viewing of this special program.I also like the fact that they weren't afraid to mention the word \"Christmas\" as well as have Linus recite the verses pertaining to the birth of Jesus. It seems everyone is so worried these days about using the word \"Christmas\" or making something seem too religious. Well, as Linus says in the cartoon, \"That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown.\" Christmas wouldn't be the same without watching this!(note: for some reason Amazon put this as a review of the VHS version. I thought I posted it as a DVD review.. anyway, I have both and they are both excellent.. the quality wasn't all that wonderful when it first premiered so that's how I remember it and that's how it comes out on the DVD and VHS tape - not the pristine quality of today's productions, but it's the cartoon itself that is great).","review\/time":"1228867200","review\/userId":"A1QVFHPY8418","tipo":"positivo"},

I have been to several live shows that were mind blowing only to see the same performance on DVD and find that the singers sounded like they were in their bathroom singing. I'm a diehard fan of Queensryche and Dio so they can do no wrong.

I'll watch it over and over. Unlike one of the other reviewers, I found the political messages pertinent - I think it shows that the original story is in fact timeless. War, money, corruption, exploitation, longing, remorse - it all makes for great drama! Also, in traditional opera or theatre, the musicians are in the pit and invisible to the audience. In Mindcrime, the musicians are front and center on stage - powerful! I would recommend this DVD especially to today's teens; current bands don't do concept albums or theatrical performances any more - what a shame.","review\/time":"1193961600","review\/userId":"AGKL6KHMGOF4","tipo":"positivo"},

I have gone to a lot of concerts and have not seen acting on stage. I guess some of you die hards like my husband expected it but it was distracting to me. It was hard to enjoy the beautiful, creative songs while watching such bad acting. And might I add that I felt as though ALL of the songs were lipsynched because the vocals were just too exact and sounded exactly the recorded versions. Bottom line, I would've rather played their cd's on my ipod than watch the heavy metal soap opera.","review\/time":"1188000000","review\/userId":"A3QR3SFHJATU","tipo":"neutral"},

Mccartney","review\/score":"4.0","review\/summary":"Mixed feelings toward this one","review\/text":"Like many other reviewers, I was introduced to Queensrche back in '83, and have seen them five times now (including this past tour). I picked up this DVD because this show was not disappointing. However, the sound just isn't the same without Chris DeGarmo. Mike Stone's performance is not bad, but there are times where his particular style tends to clash with everyone else. Another reviewer likened Geoff Tate's acting skills to that of William Shatner, I couldn't agree more, on the other hand, William Shatner can't sing like Geoff Tate.I think for me to fully enjoy the live performances of Mindcrime I and II, I've been toying around with the idea of just watching Livecrime followed by Mindcrime at the Moore (Part II). I was blown away when I saw the original Livecrime during the Empire tour, and it still ranks as one of the highest on my list of shows I've seen (Pink Floyd, SRV, Metallica, and Judas Priest are included in that list).Another disappointing part of the tour was the absence of Ronnie James Dio. Although I know it was a bit much for him to go on a lengthy tour for a measly 3-minute segment, it would have been cool to see him perform \"The Chase\" live instead of the pre-recorded version. It would have been even better if they were on tour together since I've only seen Dio on video (Sacred Heart Tour).Overall, for the die-hard Queensrche fan, this is one to add to the collection. In my opinion, the original Operation Mindcrime will definitely withstand the test of time, Mindcrime II, on the other hand, like any other sequel, loses something that can only be found in the original. Mindrime II is a fair album, and seeing it performed live helps, but it's not one of Queensrche's best efforts.","review\/time":"1187136000","review\/userId":"A3SSI750PCAX","tipo":"neutral"},

It is a fantastic, PROFESSIONALLY captured and edited spectacular, not to mention a high-quality audio track to match!Seriously, I have watched several \"live\" DVD concerts, but this production beautifully blends the live performance, terrific camera angles and imagery, and post-production editing into what can truly be called a visual and audio masterpiece. It is meticulous and detailed, capturing the exciting pulse of a live performance without compromising the cinematic story-telling that this saga requires.And let's face it, you absolutely cannot enjoy this DVD (despite all I have mentioned so far) unless Geoff Tate and the band delivered musically. Guess what? THAT'S THE BEST PART!! Tate sounds terrific! For the first half, he delivers a powerful, spot-on performance that is every bit as good as Operation LiveCrime! What chops he still has! Cripes!And the band is rock solid --- tight technically and impressive melodically. Wilton and Stone are superb, and the underpinnings of bass and drums are phenomenal, to boot.I saw the show in Baltimore and loved it. The DVD is even better! It is a worthy chronicle of a band and a story that just won't quit. I hated waiting so long for this thing, but now I am fulfilled.Go out and get it.

When the DVD wa sissued I wasnt so fast in buying it but for some reason a month or so after its release I went out and got it. What can I say I sat there with the home theatre sytem blasting it out and loved it , from the opening bars to the closing encores this is one hell of a concert , the band sound great , Geoff tates voice may not eb quite as strong as it was 20 years ago , but whose is ? He still has one of the most classical and distinctive vocals of any singer .

I have always liked the story of Operation Mindcrime 1 & 2 and was thrilled that they performed both parts live in concert. I do respect the talents of all of the band members especially the Vocals of Geoff Tate.I attended a show on this tour and was totally blown away. In fact it was one of the greatest shows I have ever saw in my life. I was thinking all throught the show I hope that they film this for either a DVD release and\/or an audio release. Now on to my review.This DVD captures the raw energy of the performance and the audience. Geoff Tate never sounded better. Sure he can no longer hit the high notes which in is case is good because in the early days all he did was wail instead of sing. Pamela Moore was excellent as well. The camera angles are both good and annoying. I felt that the camera moved to much in some places and din't move enough in others.The sound quality was mixed as well. In some areas Geoff Tate sounded great but in other parts of the DVD he sounded like he was eating the microphone. Pamela Moores vocals weren't turned up loud enough which was annoying too.The acting wasn't that good but they still pulled it of anyway. I have to remember that these arn't professional actors there rock stars. The drummer, guitar plaer and bass player were really good in there performances as well.The bonus features are amazing as well. I like how the band filmed their rehearsals for the upcoming tour. I also like how they filmed Ronnie James Dio only appearance with the band which was recorded live from Los Angeles.The bottom line is if you like the story of both operation mindcrime 1 & 2 you'll love this DVD.This DVD is also a great addition to anybody who likes concept albums as well. I will compare this to the genious of Pete Townshend's Tommy!","review\/time":"1184544000","review\/userId":"ASNUD9FXWFZS","tipo":"neutral"},

Part two...not so much.","review\/text":"Being on a tight budget as I am I knew I should have waited to buy this, but I couldn't resist. I have long been a mindcrime fanatic, I have listened to part one probably more times than should be allowed by law, and part two, while not quite as good is a thoroughly good front to back album.I will say the first act was an energizing preformance, it had an engaging mix of music, acting and visual arts that had me singing with every song. The Seattle Seahawks drum corps was an excellent addition and Mary's suicide made my heart skip a beat.It was hard not to watch the second act after watching the first, but unfortunantly after One Foot in Hell the energy really begins to leave the stage. The cover of the DVD stated that \"the Chase\" was preformed with Ronnie James Dio, but unfortunatly for that song neither Dio nore Geoff Tate are present on stage. After \"the Chase\", the remaining part of the preformance begins to bog down and I found myself waiting for Nikki to committ suicide so I could hear \"Jet City Woman\" from the encore.Overall I would give this four stars. Five for the outstanding preformance from Disk one. Disk Two gets three, losing one for promising and failing to deliver Dio in person and and another for a gradually declining preformace towards the end of disk two.","review\/time":"1187654400","review\/userId":"APAWH1DWSE3G","tipo":"neutral"},

Smith \"Cleave-ryche\"","review\/score":"2.0","review\/summary":"Disappointed...Tate has no class...he needs to leave the acting to someone else.","review\/text":"First of all, I'll give my 'positives' regarding this DVD. Mike Stone is a great guitar player...way better than Kelly Grey. Stone does a very good job on the lead work that Grey simply could not do on 'Live Evolution'. Also, using Pamela Moore to do background vocals is a plus as well.However, the production (sound, lighting, camera work) is not nearly as good as 'Evolution'. Understanding that Tate and company are telling a story here, there is too much theatrics which takes away from the music, and Tate himself does not do very well vocally.As a long time fan, I always considered Queensryche to be a band with a lot of professional class...they stood out from the rest. I suppose when Degarmo left, all of that went with him. I was quite frankly shocked by the profanity, and specifically, the pervasive use of the 'F' word and the middle finger salute throughout the production. I will never understand artists and actors who feel like using such language enhances the story. I suppose that it shows their true character as individuals.Tate has always been somewhat arrogant, and it is also obviously clear where he stands on his political views. This story could have been told without him sharing his with the rest of us. The poster disgracing Bush at the beginning of the show was tacky, tasteless, disrespectful, and just plain filthy. As I stated, this behavior stunned me, and to say the least, disappointed me. Tate has no integrity and definitely lacks character.Had I known all of this beforehand, I would not have purchased it. I know my review means nothing, and will more than likely not have any affect. I just felt like I had to give my honest opinion. To the true Ryche fan who soaks up their music, this is a disappointment.","review\/time":"1237593600","review\/userId":"A14KJ30HR6KJ","tipo":"negativo"},

It's true that Geoff Tates voice has had better days, but he sounds a lot better on this than he did on Live Evolution. However, his acting leaves much to be desired. I don't know why he decided to sport the Madonna microphone and act out parts of the show. He kind of reminded me of Meat Loaf in The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

I've been a Queensryche fan ever since the early '90s, after the release of \"Empire\", & I've seen them twice in concert, even though they were the opening act. I love Mindcrime At The Moore for tons of reasons: all 34 songs in the concert, live actors play the parts of the characters, there's different set & costume changes, lots of props, Pamela Moore, who plays Sister Mary, is in OMC1 longer than on Operation LIVECrime & she's also in OMC2, there's a video screen in the back of the stage, showing scenes that highlight the storyline and the band, themselves, are front & center, on stage & play magnificently! Also, even though Chris DeGarmo's not with them, anymore, the guitarist that replaced him, Mike Stone, does a fantastic job on guitar! Plus, we answer these questions: \"What happened to Mary?\" & \"Whatever happened to Nicky?\" I also like the bonus features, especially the tour documentary. This is a terrific concert DVD set & I recommend it to all Queensryche fans or fans of heavy metal, in general, because, believe me, it is fabulous and everyone involved in it hit a grand slam!","review\/time":"1210809600","review\/userId":"A1WEKFMSF5Q6","tipo":"positivo"},

I was disappointed that Dio was not there live, even though it was just the one track. But Pamela Moore (is she so hot they named the theater after her?)has a huge part and does a great job as Sister Mary. I did throw on the Livecrime video and did find the energy level on that to be a bit better, but all in all \"Mindcrime at the Moore\" is a fine live performance.","review\/time":"1186963200","review\/userId":"A22KTQP1M5GS","tipo":"neutral"},

This tour (10 shows attended) totally blew me away and I couldn't be happier that Queensryche decided to film it all live for this DVD. They've come full circle with Operation: Mindcrime and it was a much welcomed release to all who are fans of the story.I'm no music, mixing, guitar expert by any means, I just know what sounds good to me. The band is tight, the sound is amazing and the on stage acting was passionate and riveting. Geoff Tate's vocals are very strong and as one of the best vocalists of all time IMO, he still has that \"it\" factor. Pamela Moore does a wonderful job as Sister Mary. To the delight of the fans (especially the guys, she's HOT!) they utilize her talent quite a bit and I couldn't be happier about that. An amazing beauty which is only surpassed by that strong, rich voice of hers. Michael Wilton (guitar), Mike Stone (guitar), Eddie Jackson (bass) and Scott Rockenfield (drums) do what they do best and each is a master at his craft. The Seattle Seahawks Blue Thunder Drumline marches out and performs \"Anarchy-X\" with the band, which gets you whipped into a frenzy right from the start. All the way this DVD is filled with hard rockin' heart pumping music by the most talented of musicians, drama, tragedy, love, pain, rock, revenge, redemption, surprises and Moore!The bonus features are cool with a tour documentary that gives a glimpse into the preperations for this amazing tour.I wholeheartedly recommend the Mindcrime At The Moore DVD and CD to everyone. An absolute MUST HAVE for Rychers and a great release to convert someone to the Ryche side!BUY IT NOW and enjoy it TODAY!","review\/time":"1186272000","review\/userId":"A28HU5LHZ9UY","tipo":"positivo"},

Anderson \"Hairdresser and curly ha...","review\/score":"2.0","review\/summary":"Buyer Beware!","review\/text":"Well, there's good news and bad news. Let's take care of the bad news first.The Beachbody company itself is very difficult to deal with and you must make certain you are very careful in your dealings with them. Their \"full 30-day, money-back guarantee\" is a little misleading. Long story short, it took me almost two months to receive a full refund from them on \"additional tapes\" they shipped to me before my 30 day preview was up. They were willing to refund the cost of the product, but were refusing to refund the original shipping charges and to pay for the return shipping. They even admitted to the Better Business Bureau they only gave me 26 days to preview the program, but felt that was \"adequate.\" I had to write personally to their CEO and state my intentions to bring false advertising charges against them to the Florida state Attorney General for them to finally refund my money in full. There are many complaints against them for their questionable business practices(...).The good news: Power90 is not a bad program, not by any means. I did see some results with it and anyone who devotes the 45 minutes a day (30 minutes for Level 1\/2), 6 days a week the program demands will find some success. But you could also say the same about any program you faithfully used for that amount of time. Additionally, the production quality is very poor and it gets very, very boring after a while - the music is completely un-motivating and Tony Horton's jokes do get annoying after constant repetition. But I did like how Tony paid attention to each phase of the workout, even warm-up and cool-down. For example, countless exercise videos put emphasis on \"drink plenty of water before, during, and after the workout\", but you must remember stop your tape, interrupt your workout, and do it yourself - Tony actually builds it into his program. Also, the warm-up and cool-down stretches are some of the best I've seen.Overall, though, I don't think the program is stellar enough or different enough to warrant the risk it takes to do business with Beachbody. If you want to purchase this program and devote the time it takes to do it, I believe you will see results - but there are plenty of other programs out there that could deliver the same results for you without the headaches of having to deal with Beachbody.","review\/time":"1123113600","review\/userId":"AVE9HG5MU108","tipo":"neutral"},

People started noticing a difference in my physique within 30-40 days, and the improvements continued throughout the cycle.A few caveats - if you want to make continuous progress, buy a set of bands or dumbbells separate so you can progress your weights upward. The 90 days of essentially 4 workouts (30 days of the 1-2 series and 60 of the 3-4 series) make for a bit of boredom and repetition.

Things lead to an emotional but very happy ending and Emma finds herself a favorite among the maids and the masters of the house. Emma's love, Will, back in London can not get her out of his mind and falls into depression but finds comfort in Miss Campbell, a sweet noble girl. The two begin to fall in love.

I won't waste any more of my time typing or your time reading. Although $18 for 32 shorts may sound like a good deal, it isn't. Take the $18 and put it toward Chaplin's 3 Essanay Vol's or his 90th anniversary Mutual set. You won't believe the difference. After purchasing those sets, I threw this one away.

The reason I thought it was a movie and not a 'talking about rodeos and what horses are best for this type of thing' was because it said: \"Go behind the scenes to see just what it takes to make a barrel racing horse, a performing horse, a trail riding horse and even a police horse! Interviews with trainers, handlers, riders, and owners provide an up close and personal look at the various roles of this beautiful and majestic animal.\" So I thought that those would just be behind the scenes things but it is in fact what this dvd is. So if you are looking for a movie story about horses and are being fooled by the cover as I was please know this is NOT a movie.Note: I rated this 1 star because my experience. The dvd was in perfect condition and shipped fast so that is not a reflection on those things, just the fact that I wasn't happy that the cover looks like a movie season and I was dissapointed when it arrived and I found out what it was.","review\/time":"1357689600","review\/userId":"A10PL25ZXJVZ","tipo":"negativo"},

I am a life-long Jerry Lewis fan, I adore many of his movies, but not this one. It is pointless tripe. I never thought I'd give up on a Jerry Lewis movie, without watching it all the way through. But after 50 minutes, I felt like shouting back at Dean Martin for his odious carry on in this film. Whoever wrote the script doesn't know the first thing about humour.

The pace is slow--not that this is good or bad--just a fact. Here is the man who treats the Dalai Lama and monks who were treated horrifically by the Chinese, as well as those who have been told there is no cure for them. The story of one of the female monks brought tears to my eyes and to the eyes of the practitioners who was treating her. I wouldn't be alive today without Chinese medicine, so my view of this DVD is from this viewpoint of gratitude and respect for these loving practitioners. If you've been told there is no hope for you, seek a Chinese doctor with many years of practicing the art of Chinese herbs, diagnosis, and acupuncture.

About the only thing I hadn't heard before was a part on how there was a war going on at the time they recorded this where they where staying, but where too busy to even notice. And it's just annoying that they are supposed to be talking about this great album but cant help but throw in a few lines of, \"Brian us s*** compared to Bon\" and how would Bon have done the album and Bon this, Bon that. The fact is, you can say what you want but the album is Brian, so live with it \"experts\"Then there is a few members of Dirty DC playing the songs... big deal... I want to see AC\/DC do it, not a cover band and there guess' and opinions.About the only person interviewed on this who knows what he is talking about is the production guy on the album, or whoever he was. He was actually there and has facts to say, not just opinions, guess' and ideas of what MIGHT have been.Don't waste your time on this, these experts are idiots and don't tell you anything new. It's just so dumb that they release themselves on one DVD saying how bad Brian is and wishing Bon was still around, then they come out on this saying it's the greatest album of all time.I've had enough of these things. If it doesn't have AC\/DC members talking about it (and that does not include past members) then don't bother with it. And this one does not have a single member of AC\/DC to be heard. Just half a live song. They couldn't even let you watch the whole thing.What makes these people \"experts\"? They wrote a book on them? Asked someone who knows AC\/DC? Have any of them actually met any of them and gotten a straight answer out of AC\/DC? Usually AC\/DC respond with jokes... for example, it's mentioned in this that Brian was asked what \"Giving The Dog A Bone\" was about and he replied, \"it's about cats and dogs\" because he loves animals... and the guy says he doesn't think so. Well, DUHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!! Brian was joking when he said that, did Brian have to make that clearer? What the heck do you think the songs about? It doesn't take a genius to work out the obvious. Brian was taking the p*** out the person who asked that question cause it's too obvious what it's about and Brian gave a better answer by joking then just saying, \"it's about sex dummy\"experts, uh huh, sure.

This one is really sleazy. In fact, the sex far outweighs the violence. And the many sex scenes are quite graphic, bordering on hardcore. It also is nasty, most notably in the massage parlor scene, where a sadist beats a woman with his belt.A SCREAM IN THE STREETS revolves around the fight of two cops against the criminal scum - robbers, a peeping tom and a crossdressing serial killer, who looks HORRIBLE. And his female victims are not too smart, since he approaches them as a very unconvincing \"woman\", and they (including a plain cloth female detective!) don't even notice!Like many cop movies of its time, A SCREAM... has an openly self-justice stance. Watch out for the final scene, which also makes good use of the split-screen technique, which was very popular in the early 70ies.As you have probably guessed by now, this is politically NOT correct and because of this much fun!Picture quality is very impressive. SWV has done a great job with the transfer. As usual SWV's DVD offers a lot of extra features. There is of course the film's trailer, which includes footage not shown in the film. All in all there is a dozen of trailers, either US exploitation fare or old French crime flicks. My personal favorite among the trailers is THE GODSON starring overbusty Uschi DIGARD (this film will be released on DVD soon). A \"play all\" option for the trailers would have been helpful.Also included are five shorts, of which I liked THE PROWLER best. Since I am a true crime buff this early 60ies black and white instruction film for police officers was very compelling viewing for me. Also interesting is CRIME IN THE STREET, an instructional documentary about crime prevention featuring a very young Chuck NORRIS (then karate trainer). The film is entertaining but somehow pointless, because all of the advice given is so wellknown and common sense.I did not like the other three shorts very much. HARRY NOVAK, CRIME BUSTER is a kind of documentary, where a film crew visits movie producer Harry NOVAK. After fooling around NOVAK (jokingly) suggests that they visit a business partner, who paid with a foul cheque. NOVAK brandishes a samurai sword and a rifle to enhance his arguments. Strange business customs... Another short is an extremely silly sex movie, boring beyond belief and due to horrible print quality almost unwatchable. The last short feature is a black and white burlesque striptease. Boring, and by the way: You don't get to see something.Far better is the extensive still gallery of Harry NOVAK films.Buy the DVD but better skip the three last shorts in the extra features.","review\/time":"1043798400","review\/userId":"A24MVVGNFVG6","tipo":"positivo"},

The film has a certain amount of charm, but it is quickly bogged down by weak storytelling & unbelievable plot points.Dim Sum Funeral surrounds a group of siblings who must return home after the death of their mother- someone that they all detested. Their mother had requested a traditional Chinese funeral, which is supposed to take place over several days. As the days pass the siblings discover that there was more to their mother than they'd previously believed & they also find their own personal affairs beginning to surface as well.The idea of the movie was good, I'll give them that. Funeral traditions from different countries have always intrigued me, so I would have thought that I'd like this more. About 20-40 minutes into the movie, I knew that this was just disappointing. From the beginning we're shown how incredibly different all of the siblings are, however it just felt like the writers tried to hard to give each person a tragic and\/or unique personality. There's just too much going on from each sibling & it wasn't handled very well. You have a lesbian trying to get herself (or her girlfriend) pregnant, a philandering doctor, an older sibling dealing with the death of her child, as well as a younger sibling who is in for a startling surprise about herself. Better films have dealt with similar situations & managed to juggle all of the multiple plot lines, but in this film they dropped the ball & made for a cluttered plot line.Then there's the unrealistic parts of the film. I apologize if this comes across a little spoilerish, but I found it incredibly unrealistic that all of the siblings dealt with their issues during the 4-5 day period as well as managing to forgive their mother for any past actions. As one person put it- really? Death solves all of the emotional problems? I also found it unbelievable that with all of the emphasis on sibling rivalries, that everyone put their issues aside so quickly. Then there's the ending... I won't elaborate on what happens, but needless to say- both my mother & I audibly groaned at the twist.This is a mostly harmless movie & there are one or two interesting things, but this isn't something I'd really recommend spending money on. *Maybe* a rental, but if you can catch this on TV for free then that's what I'd recommend.","review\/time":"1274572800","review\/userId":"A2XNOB1T796Y","tipo":"negativo"},

Both involved coping with death, but the similarities ended there. While \"Okuribito\" was well-written, acted, and filmed with an involving story and likable characters, \"Dim Sum Funeral\" was a complete turn-off.A controlling first-generation Chinese-American woman died and requested that her dysfunctional, self-absorbed children give her a traditional Chinese funeral. They were so Americanized it took the help of their Jewish nanny\/ mother's-assistant to fill them in on protocol. The story contained so many twists and complications in the characters' lives that it appeared to be a formulaic exercise in seeing how many problems and how much diversity could be crammed into a 1 1\/2 hour film. Ordinary Asian Americans didn't bring enough to the table, so how about making one sibling an illegitimate dope-smoking surly lesbian who wanted a baby, another an over-eating single mother, another the model daughter who recently lost her son, and another a philandering, self-loathing, rich cosmetic surgeon married to a beauty queen?At least Chang Tseng's character provided some relief by being pleasantly funny in a sea of mean-spiritedness. Perhaps because his character wasn't part of the family, he did not contract their self-centered angst.Apparently the writers thought selfishness was a virtue. A Buddhist monk experienced a spiritual \"epiphany\" from his conversations with the rebellious lesbian couple. And what was his enlightenment? He learned that it is better to live for oneself instead of to please other people. Yes, folks, narcissism lies within the veil of Nirvana.\"Okuribito\" showed how a film can do a lot with a little. \"Dim Sum Funeral\" showed that a film can do little with far too much.","review\/time":"1265155200","review\/userId":"A1RXCODDDOWX","tipo":"neutral"},

The 1st and 2nd movies are worth buying this set (both of which can cost you around $30)3. Each dvd has a bonus dvd4. It comes with a box to hold all 3 dvdsNote: I awarded 2 stars for the 1st reason if you were wondering why I gave it 5 starsConclusion: If you are a fan of the series and do not own any of the dvds, this is the set to get.

Instead, I'm just going to give a quick overview of what to expect from the Blu-Ray trilogy.First, SPIDER-MAN 3 is the same release as the double-disc Blu-Ray stand-alone version. It has lots of special features, commentaries, an extras disc, etc. The movie itself looks very, very good (video quality).It's SPIDER-MAN 1&2 where the set takes a hit. Again, video quality is excellent. SPIDER-MAN 2 includes the \"2.1\" cut (via seamless branching, meaning you can watch the theatrical or the new version off the same disc) with extra scenes, including at least one that is VERY funny.However, what you lose are ALL the extras from the SM 1&2 DVD releases. No commentaries, no deleted scenes (other than \"2.1\"), no \"makings-of\", etc. To me, this was more than disappointing. It's almost criminal. I expected many of the old items to appear in standard-def. Only one bonus blu-ray disc would have been required to hold every single non-commentary special feature, as BD's have 50GB of space compared to 9GB for a standard DVD. Why skimp here, Sony?Ultimately, this is the best way to view the movies. They look AMAZING. The extras in this set, however, are underwhelming, to say the least. You're getting everything you need for SM3, but the first two films are severely shortchanged.","review\/time":"1193702400","review\/userId":"ADA2CQJK7DXS","tipo":"neutral"},

There Goes The Spider-Man [Movies]!","review\/text":"Hi, Fat Boy. I am the world-famous film critic, Movie Review Kid, who is gonna tell YOU how to lose weight. First, you need to exercise daily and stop eating fatty foods. Now that I'm done with that, let's get on with the review.This week's movie is Spider-Man-The Motion Picture DVD Trilogy. This little beauty contains the three Spidey movies (Spider-Man [2002], Spider-Man 2 [2004] and Spider-Man 3 [2007]) which are conveniently packaged in this low-priced box set. The movies star Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker a.k.a. your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Kirsten Dunst is the Girl Next Door, Mary Jane Watson, Spidey's love interest. And James Franco as Harry Osborn, Peter's best friend, until he finds out that Peter is Spider-Man who killed his father (explained in more detail below.)Spider-Man is a famous Marvel Comics superhero. With every superhero comes supervillians. A rogues gallery of Spidey's fiercest enemies appear in the trilogy. In Spider-Man, it's the Green Goblin (played by William Dafoe), who is the father of Harry Osborn, turned evil. In Spider-Man 2, it is Doctor Octopus, abbreviated Doc Ock (played by Alfred Molina), a former scientist who is controlled by his evil robot tentacles. In Spider-Man 3, it is New Goblin (James Franco) a.k.a. Harry Osborn who tries to get revenge on Peter after finding out that he killed his father. Another Spidey 3 villian is Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), a burgular who gains sand powers after falling into a particle acclerator (I have no idea what that is). The final Spidey 3 villian is Venom (Topher Grace) a photographer who is stricken with an alien symbiote and given the same powers as Spider-Man, but uses them for evil use.Now that we've patched that up, I--Are you eating chips? If you wanna lose weight, you have got to stop eating this junk. Hey, I see those pork rinds under the pillow. Give them to me! Yeesh, no wonder you're so fat. I bet your mama's that fat, too.--should start telling you about the movies themselves.Spider-Man: High school student Peter Parker's life dramatically changes after he is bitten by a radioactive spider and receives spider powers. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn turns into the Green Goblin and starts terrorizing the people of New York City. Peter starts using his powers to gain publicity and make some extra dough. So this guy who was supposed to give Peter money doesn't give him the money, see. So after that guy gets robbed, Peter lets the thief get away. Then, that thief goes and shoots Peter's Uncle. Ironic, isn't it? Then Peter learns \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" He then becomes Spider-Man, saving people and whatnot. He faces the Goblin on several occasions and the Goblin tries to convince Spidey to join him in a life of crime but Spidey disagrees. It all ends in a climatic battle between the Spider and Goblin and the Goblin ends up dying (Spidey did not kill him; he died by his own hand). Spidey then sends the Goblin home and then Harry sees him and thinks that Spider-Man killed his father. After the funeral, he vows that Spider-Man will pay.Well, after that intense ending, Spider-Man leaves ya begging for more. Two years later, you stop begging. Why? 'Cause the second movie's in theaters. The storyline goes like this:Spider-Man 2: Peter is having a hard time balancing his normal life and his superhero life. First, he's failing school. Second, his best friend, Harry, is out to revenge on Spidey. Third, the girl he loves, Mary Jane, is getting married to John Jameson, the son of the editor of the Daily Bugle (Peter's boss). Dr. Otto Octavius, a scientist, creates these four mechanical arms, or tentacles, to handle this big ball of fire that he is unveiling to everybody. Then, everything goes haywire and there is explosions and Peter transforms into Spider-Man to try to help get things back on track. In all the ruckus, Octavius's wife dies and the scientist decides to blame Spidey for the incident. Then the four mechanical arms mend into his body and he becomes Doctor Octopus. Spidey later temporarily loses his powers and Doc Ock (hearing that Peter is close to Spidey) commands Peter to tell Spidey to meet him at some place or else he'll kill Mary Jane. That scene also has a cool scene where a car comes crashing through the window, that's so cool. Peter gets his power back and the Spider and the Octopus face off in an epic battle. Also, Mary Jane and Harry end up finding out that Peter is Spider-Man. Suprising, huh? I can't tell you how they found out, that would ruin the supriseness.It all ends in this movie. Check it out.Spider-Man 3: Spidey\/Peter's life is going great. He has finally got the girl (Mary Jane) and can balance his life. But his friend (Harry) now hates him 'cause he thought that Spider-Man killed his father and then he found out that Spider-Man is his buddy, Peter. Harry then dons the same suit his deranged father had and becomes the New Goblin. He faces off against Peter but gets sent to the hospital afterward. When he is released from the hospital, he cannot remember that Spider-Man killed his dad or that Peter was Spider-Man, which is good news for Peter. But Peter's luck changes when he finds out that the man who killed his uncle (the thief from the first movie) was actually NOT the guy who killed his uncle and that the actual guy who killed his uncle is Flint Marko, a thief who is still at large. This angers Peter because he finds out that when he killed his uncle's shooter, he actually killed an innocient man and that his uncle's real killer is still out there. Now, Flint Marko actually falls into that particle accelerator and becomes half-man, half-sand, or Sandman. So, when Sandman robs a bank and Spider-Man tries to stop him, Spider-Man gets a mouthful of sand. Also, another problem Peter faced was Eddie Brock, a photographer who is out to get Peter's job. Also, an alien symbiote from outer space attaches to Spider-Man turning his suit black, and making him evil, adding to his rage. Now he is equally-matched to Sandman, defeating him once and for all, or so Peter thinks. And also Mary Jane, gets bad reviews from critics about her new Broadway and is upset about it, but Peter has to worry about other things. Then, Harry regains his memory and forces Mary Jane to tell Peter that she does not love him anymore. Then, Peter goes out with Gwen Stacy, trying to make Mary Jane jealous. He causes a mess at the club where Mary Jane sings and ends up throwing her on the floor. Realizing that the symbiote that was controlling his life caused this, he hurries to take it off. When Peter strips the black suit off, Eddie Brock (who Peter recently had fired) is standing below and inherits the black suit and becomes Venom. Venom and Sandman team up to defeat Peter, holding Mary Jane hostage. The ending is intense and you just won't believe it. But I saw the ending, and I believed it.Whew! That was long. I guess this brings my review to an end. If you afford this package, just settle for the individual DVDs then. They also have the trilogy in Blu-Ray, for those who wanna advance. Well then, good-bye from the Movie Review KId...and try to follow my weight loss tips.P.S. It is not the end of the Spider-Man film series. On May 6, 2011, Spider-Man 4 will be released. No lie.","review\/time":"1246406400","review\/userId":"unknown","tipo":"negativo"},

We all know that the original SPIDERMAN was an amzing film - a rare treat of exemplary action with superb acting for a change. Tobey Maguire and cast finally brought to the comic action movie acting ability that made the film believable. With Tobey Maguire was born Peter Parker\/Spdiderman. We also know that with SPIDERMAN 2 the same cast and crew came together with a film that far surpassed the hugely succesful and critically acclaimed original to be the best in the trilogy. All that was good in the first was raised many notches. SPIDERMAN 3 was still a good film but certainly not a match for 1 and 2. Very enjoyable but a little lackluster in comparison.Now for the blu ray test. All I can say is AMAZING. The source they are working from on the original is not as superb as the other two which makes the picture quality slightly grainy in its 1080p hd presentation. But this in no means is a bad thing. It is still a very vivid picture with blacks and colors strongly presented. You quickly get used to the slight grain and the film becomes the best presentation you will ever see of it. With SPIDERMAN 2 the caliber raises. All grain is gone and the picture remains crystal clear and vibrant throughout. All fight\/action scenes are awesome and the entire film will leave you breathless. SPIDERMAN 3 has a picture of the great quality the same as the second film and it helps immensely to raise the quality of the film itself much higher for you will be in awe watching the richness and awe striking special effects.With all three films the English Dolby TrueHD 5.1 audio is of the highest quality. Dialogue is strong and crisp with all speakers in strong, heavy use for action sequences and it seems even the smallest scenes manage to work the rear speakers which is rare. These three films are at their best here and perfectly made for the high standards of blu ray. You cannot imagine how great these films appear in blu ray till you actually see them for yourself. You will never be able to view them another way again.I do agree that the only flaw with this set is the absence of substantial special features. They do provide the 2nd disc with SPIDERMAN 3 that is all features but do not have it for SPIDERMAN 1 or 2. Having all this would have made the set perfect. So it is not perfect but it still cannot make me lower my 5 star rating for the blu ray presentation of these films is exemplary.If you are developing a blu ray library and love these films this SPIDERMAN HIGH DEF BLU RAY TRILOGY is a definite must. Highly recommended.","review\/time":"1233446400","review\/userId":"A3EUSH8DPW75","tipo":"positivo"},

The low cost (even lower by $10 since I bought it) is what motivated me to buy this blu-ray disc set. I already have the special editions of all three Spiderman movies on DVD, so I wanted to see what blu-ray would bring to the home theater table, having recently bought a PS3. True, the picture quality is awesome and the audio certainly will blow you away. However, there are hardly any special features - only the third disc has any to speak of. This is an underwhelming effort, considering the massive amount of space availalble on blu-ray discs. Compare, for example, the featurettes and even mini-movies on \"I Am Legend\".One thing I discovered about audio selection: if you choose PCM and your receiver is not capable of processing uncompressed signals (my Onkyo only does HDMI pass-through), all you'll get is simulated surround (e.g. Dolby ProLogic). So I ended up with 5.1 and although it may not be true HD, it's good enough for my 7.1 setup. But if you're an audiophile you would have known about this already.My summary - HD picture quality: a strong 4 stars, audio quality and options: 4 stars, special features: a dismal 1 star - hence the overall 3 star rating. I guess for the price, this set is not too bad, but considering the wealth of possibilities for the Spiderman franchise, it fell short of my expectations.","review\/time":"1208390400","review\/userId":"A65AYP6AZGVP","tipo":"negativo"},

Not a perfect set, but enough to make it a \"Must Have\" Blu-Ray","review\/text":"This review is for the Spider-Man: Ultimate High Definition trilogy Box Set.It contains the following films: \"Spider-Man\" (2002), \"Spider-Man 2\" (2004), \"Spider-Man 2.1\" (an extended cut of Spider-Man 2 featuring some new sequences, and some entirely different alternate scenes) and \"Spider-Man 3\" (2007).As for the films, I'd rate them as such:\"Spider-Man\" ... 8 out of 10\"Spider-Man 2\/2.1\" ... 10 out of 10\"Spider-Man 3\" ... 7 out of 10 (I didn't hate it, it had a charm and a lot of good factors, despite it's obvious large faults.)The Blu-Ray image is pretty incredible. I already owned all three on DVD, but I wanted to upgrade, as these films deserve the High-Def treatment. All three look significantly better, compared to their standard-def DVD counterparts. The first \"Spider-Man\" is the least dramatic upgrade, but the image is still clearer, sharper and more detailed... I was able to see a lot of things I missed on DVD (I didn't realize how much of the image was lost on DVD from compression and whatnot, because every shot I was seeing things I hadn't seen since the movie theater in 2002)- so even though it wasn't the greatest Blu-Ray picture quality, it was still definitely worth the upgrade.The second and third films are where the High-Def image pays off, though! I had just watched the second and third films days before this set arrived on DVD, and it is like night and day. \"Spider-Man 2\" was astounding in terms of how much more I could see in the image. You felt like you could reach into the movie. Textures looked real (DVD won't give you that), colors were brighter, small things (sparks, bits of glass, sweat, water) had astonishingly more detail. It was a huge upgrade. And \"Spider-Man 3\" was just as incredible- what really got me is that you could literally see things that are invisible on the DVD (Ex. You can see every single speck of sand during the Sandman scenes, and when we see the news broadcast towards the end of the film, I couldn't see the \"horizontal TV lines\" on DVD at all, whereas here, they're clearly visible.).I can't comment much for sound, as I just play my sound through the TV speakers, but judging from that, everything is mixed well.The special features are where this review almost slips- the only special features are those from \"Spider-Man 3\", which felt a bit odd. They are cool features, but it seemed like a missed opprotunity.But all in all, the price (which has come down a lot) makes it worth it. You can find really good quality used or even new copies in the $25-$35 range, so I can't complain much about the features- the price is right, the quality is amazing, and what features there are, are very solid.I'd highly recommend this set! Great films.","review\/time":"1300233600","review\/userId":"A3QK8LDWVJHI","tipo":"positivo"},

Based on the success of the cartoons, this was sure to pull in a very specific demographic, but I doubt they expected it to be as popular as it became. It surpassed the success of X-Men, and ushered in a decade that would have many more comic book, cartoon, and toy movies set records. For too many years, these types of properties did not get the respect they deserved as real dramatic and action movies, and not just dumb superhero fun. Spider-Man finally got that due respect. The weekend it came out, my focus was on Star Wars Episode II, but after I saw Spider-Man I was blown away. Like many others of my generation, my fandome really started with the first Spidey film, and then blossomed into collecting stacks upon stacks of comics. The visual effects were not the standard for the time, especially with the aforementioned Star Wars film coming out, but they were still pretty damn good. The music was fantastic, thanks to Danny Elfman (the man behind The Simpsons music, and so many other great film scores). Director Sam Raimi created a truly stylistic and visual masterpiece. Honestly, I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead series. I doubted a director best known for horror movies would do the material justice, but he did not disappoint.Neither did the cast. All of the actors were fairly new to me. I had no idea who most of them were, except Kirsten Dunst I knew from Small Soldiers (I was a child). But I always applaud and appreciate big blockbusters that turn lesser names into household names. Tobey maguire and Dunst had a chemistry that really dold the complex relationship of the two iconic characters they were portraying. To this day, my favorite character, besides Spider-Man, is definitely JK Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. If ever there were an actor born to play a specific supporting role, it was him. Willem Dafoe was great as Norman Osborn. As the serum changed him from a desperate businessman to a conflicted monster, the not so subtle nuances of Dafoe's performance really began to shine through. If only Green Goblin's costume had less of a silly looking design, then his character would be one of the premier villains in Marvel film history. As it stands, Goblin's costume only hurts the film by making it seem more campy than it really is. It serves as a constant reminder that you're watching a cartoon with real people acting it out. Nevertheless, Spider-Man should definitely be creditted as the film that sparked the hype and interest that comic book adaptations get today. If it were not for Spider-Man (as well as Blade and X-Men), I doubt that movies like Watchmen, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Fantastic 4, Ghost Rider, Punisher, Dare Devil, or any of the other countless comic book and superhero flicks would have been taken seriously enough to be converted from script into film.And the Blu-ray presentation of this old favorite of mine was night and day upon my discovery of the disc. I had seen the DVDs countless times, but it wasn't until my eyes were laid upon the BD that I appreciated every inch of every frame as they were shot. Detail is remarkable. Color is rich. It truly is like watching the movie for the very first time.Spider-Man 2 is what fans dream about when the sequal to a movie as fantastic as Spider-Man is announced. Topping a film as great as that one is a definite challenge, but it seems to happen more and more each passing year. Sequals like this one, X2: X-Men United, T2: Judgement Day, The Dark Knight, and others all have one thing in common. Beyond just being a \"sequal\", they managed to outdo their predecessors in almost every way. Spider-Man 2 is not only a great sequal, it is one of the best comic book movies ever made. It doesn't go for the mature adult feel that The Dark Knight has. On the contrary, Spider-Man 2 maintains that corny camp and tongue-in-cheek humor that made the first one so good. Sure some of the dialogue is cheesy at times, and the action is never tries to be realistic, but isn't that why we go to these movies? To be virtually thrilled to the point of exhaustion? Okay, maybe that's taking it a bit far, but my point remains that these films don't need to strive for realism. Their fantasy elements and use of childlike imagination and wonder are what make them so great.Its about a man with spider-like abilities fighting a man with mechanical tentacles attached to his back. The only thing I felt was lacking in TDK, is very abundant in Spidey 2. There is great humor, and the movie has the overall feel of an actual comic book. I also got a sense of the director and writers respect for their source material, but not being afraid to have fun with it. The ending of this film gave me chills the first few times I saw it. It wasn't until Spider-Man 3 actually came out, that the end of Spidey 2 lost some of its magic. Spider-Man 2 is in a solid second place on the list of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Right above films like The Avengers, Sin City, Iron Man, etc. There is really only one thing I didn't like about the movie. There were too many close-ups of random women screaming. It was okay once or twice, but not four or five times. That's minor though. This movie was a fine achievement. As for the Blu-ray transfer. Is it as great as the first one's? An emphatic yes! Even better, in fact. The adundance of detail and clarity are remarkable. This disc is a reference disc to show how amazing catalogue blockbusters can look.As far as Spider-Man 3 goes, I want start off by saying that I like this movie. Probally more than you do. With that said, I'll also add that it does serve its purpose, which is to prove that any Spider-Man movie will have great special effects, fine character development, okay acting, and make a shitload of money. Spider-Man 3 is a good film in its own right, but only a decent one when put in the tall dark shadow of its amazing, and incredibly revolutionary predecessors. It does not add much of value to the franchise, aside from introducing some of the most popular characters in Spidey's publication history. That said, those characters aren't given the attention and respect they deserve. They feel more like late additions that were shoehorned in. Overall the movie was not terrible though. It was definitely better than both of the Fantastic 4 movies, Ghost Rider, Elektra, and Daredevil, as well as some other less than savory comic book adaptations. The only thing that really held this movie down were the, not one, but two unnecessary dance scenes, and underdeveloped characters. The worst of the two dance scenes was Peter walking down the street like he was in a music video. The second dance scene reminded me of the jazz flute scene in Anchorman. That should never be. Those scenes made me feel like Sam Raimi was too comfortable with the fact that the movie would make alot of money, and there was no major competition in the superhero\/comic book movie department, besides a few hits and a couple of upcoming challengers.That may have been passable in the summer of 2007, but now we have The Avengers saga and The Dark Knight trilogy that have set the bar so high that movies like them should be treated with the utmost respect and care. The addition of Gwen Stacy seemed rather pointless to me, unless they planned on ellaborating on the love triangle between her, Peter, and Mary Jane from the comics in later installments that never came to fruition. The running time was noticably longer than the previous two films, and it felt like a bloated Thanksgiving turkey. There's no reason the two dance scenes should have made the final cut. Some editors and directors don't understand what truly qualifies as a \"Deleted Scene\". Aside from the dance scenes, perhaps the biggest issue I have with this film is the treatment of my all-time favorite Spidey villain, Venom. Venom was so obviously a late addition to the script that it made me mad. And in addition to that, he was not the towering, manacing presence that we know him as. I must admit though, I loved the wonderful, yet very predictable team-ups of Spider-Man and the New Goblin versus Sandman and Venom. That really brought something to the movie when it was in desperate need of a kick-start. Spidey 3 was not the disaster it has so often been called by geeks and armchair critics alike, but it wasn't an achievement either.Now for the Blu-ray treatment of this rather mid-level, if slightly above average comic book film. Simply put, it's reference quality. The audio and video transfers are pretty much flawless. The extras are incredibly thorough and comprehensive as well. This trilogy is one of the best looking and sounding sets on the market. The only flaw with the set, aside from the decrease in quality entering the third installment, is the lack of extras on the first two discs. Overall though, this set is Highly Recommended, but the re-releases of the first two films are better than the first two discs in this set.","review\/time":"1344816000","review\/userId":"AHBNPMHDWZ7S","tipo":"positivo"},

The first Spider-Man movie, while occasionally deviating from the original storyline, was a great movie. It was mostly true to Stan Lee and Steve Ditko's original tale of the web-slinger. It pulled on the Norman Osborn\/Green Goblin storylines and was really enjoyable.The second movie was more goodness and was also really well done. This time we are introduced to Doctor Octopus and we see the beginnings of Harry Osborn going crazy (to later become the second Green Goblin).The third movie was pretty bad, and I am a huge Spider-Man fan. While I really wanted to see Venom as the villain for the third movie, his whole story arc didn't mesh well with the Sandman\/Green Goblin arc. And it also didn't help that Topher Grace played the part of Eddie Brock. All I could see is the kid from That 70's Show (not to say anything bad about Topher or the show, I liked them both). But since when was Eddie Brock a puny kid with a grudge? And what's with the symbiote lifting to show his face all the time? This movie had so much potential, but failed to be up to the quality of its predecessors.As for the blu-ray trilogy, it looks amazing! The quality and clarity of the picture is truly great. The only negative I have against the trilogy is the lack of special features for the first movie. With the amount of space on a blu-ray disc, I'm surprised to see so little.","review\/time":"1294012800","review\/userId":"AHL3ES7DCWZJ","tipo":"positivo"},

The trilogy as a whole is awesome, and the price can't be beat.Don't get a bunch of extra expensive editions of Spider-Man 3. There's no deleted scenes, so there's no hope of seeing what Venom bits were not included. If you're like me, and waited until now to buy these films, ow is the chance.","review\/time":"1193702400","review\/userId":"ANZD2PD11MAV","tipo":"positivo"},

It demonstrated how a fundamentally idiotic idea (attaining super powers from the bite of a radioactive spider has been mercilessly parodied) could work, if the story resonated with the readers. Lee and Ditko had the sense to make the hero a geeky teenager who has super powers thrust on him, without the experience or wisdom to know what to do. The parallel with the transition from puberty to maturity is obvious, but it works. \"Spider-Man\" was probably the biggest single influence in moving comic books away from melodrama and toward drama.Sam Raimi, a director notorious for over-the-top silliness, would seem the least-likely choice for such material, but he handles it perfectly. The focus is firmly on Peter's relationships with his family and Mary-Jane, even in the third film (which has too many villains, and too many plot lines to tie up). It's underplayed, with Maguire's performance convincingly shy without being sappy. He might be a geek, but he's no dork. Rosemary Harris is especially fine as everyone's idea of the perfect nuturing aunt. Her performance is much better than it has to be.The only unbelievable character is J Jonah Jameson, but then, he was over-the-top in the comics, too; no Perry White, he. J K Simmons (perhaps best-known as the bisexual Nazi murderer-rapist in HBO's \"Oz\") shows he's just as good at comedy, nailing the character. (No jokes, please.)If the Spider-Man films have a problem, it's that there's a limited number of feats a super hero can perform, and only so many emotional conflicts a human being can experience. Not surprisingly, their situations and story arcs are uncomfortably like those in the first three Superman films: Peter swings up to catch Mary Jane as she falls (he later repeats the act with his aunt). He abandons his super-identify because it interferes with what he most wants out of life. People \"on the street\" aid him when he's in trouble. He even loses and regains his super powers. And in the third film, Gwen Stacy's inevitable fall from a building is so close to Lois Lane's helicopter fall (with the mic cable replaced by a telephone cord) that it verges on plagiarism. Not to mention that, as in S3, a drastic change in the hero's personality is a central plot element. Whether or not this is conscious copying, it does give an uncomfortable sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu, which is why I've awarded these well-done and entertaining films only four stars.I can't resist pointing out that, as with most super-hero films, there is an utter disregard for the laws of physics. Worse, the animators don't understand one of the most-basic: F = ma. Objects and people move almost instantly from rest to motion (or back), which is not only unrealisitc, but impossible. (Disney had a good grasp of this 70 years ago. Digital animators don't seem to have caught it. Note, for example, how Shrek moves as if his body is massless.) S-M3 also overlooks e = mv^2\/2 -- there's no way a swinging crane could crack a building's girders.The Blu-ray transfers are of the high quality one expects. (They \/ought\/ to be -- Sony owns Columbia.) The second film includes the extended \"2.1\" version. I don't believe there's any supplemental material that hasn't already appeared on the DVDs.","review\/time":"1243382400","review\/userId":"ARFCORBCTKX1","tipo":"negativo"},
